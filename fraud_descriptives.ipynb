         " item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data table_start overview table_end this management analysis of financial position and results of operations pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation old republic ori or the company the company conducts its operations through a number of regulated insurance company subsidiaries organized into three major segments general insurance property and liability insurance title insurance and republic financial indemnity group rfig run off a small life and accident insurance business accounting for 0 1 of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2022 and 0 5 of consolidated assets as of that date is included within the corporate other caption of this report the consolidated accounts are presented in conformity with the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as a publicly held company old republic utilizes gaap to comply with the financial reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec from time to time the fasb and the sec issue various releases most of which require additional financial statement disclosures and provide related application guidance recent guidance issued by the fasb is summarized further in the notes to consolidated financial statements where applicable as a state regulated financial institution vested with the public interest however business of the company s insurance subsidiaries is managed pursuant to the laws regulations and accounting practices of the various states in the u s and those of a small number of other jurisdictions outside the u s in which they operate in comparison with gaap the statutory accounting practices generally reflect greater conservatism and comparability among insurers and are intended to address the primary financial security interests of policyholders and their beneficiaries additionally these practices also affect a significant number of important factors such as product pricing risk bearing capacity and capital adequacy the determination of federal income taxes payable currently among ori s tax consolidated entities and the upstreaming of dividends by insurance subsidiaries to the parent holding company the major differences between these statutory financial accounting practices and gaap are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the insurance business is distinguished from most others in that the prices premiums charged for most products are set without knowing what the ultimate loss costs will be the company also cannot know exactly when claims will be paid which may be many years after a policy was issued or expired this casts old republic as a risk taking enterprise managed for the long run old republic therefore conducts the business with a primary focus on achieving favorable underwriting results over cycles and on maintaining a sound financial condition to support our subsidiaries long term obligations to policyholders and their beneficiaries to achieve these objectives adherence to insurance risk management principles is stressed and asset diversification and quality are emphasized in addition management engages in an ongoing assessment of operating risks such as cybersecurity risks that could adversely affect the company s business and reputation in addition to income arising from old republic s basic underwriting and related services functions significant investment income is earned from invested funds generated by those functions and from capital resources investment management aims for stability of income from interest and dividends protection of capital and for sufficiency of liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future securities trading and the realization of capital gains are not primary objectives the investment philosophy is therefore best characterized as emphasizing value credit quality and relatively long term holding periods the company s ability to hold both fixed income and equity securities for long periods of time is enabled by the scheduling of maturities in contemplation of an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities and by investments in dividend paying publicly traded large capitalization highly liquid equity securities in light of the above factors the company is managed for the long run and with little regard for quarterly or even annual reporting periods these time frames are too short management believes results are best evaluated by looking at underwriting and overall operating performance trends over 10 year intervals these likely include one or two economic and or underwriting cycles this provides enough time for these cycles to run its course for premium rate changes and subsequent underwriting results to be reflected in financial statements and for reserved loss costs to be quantified with greater accuracy this management analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the footnotes appended to them table_start executive summary table_end old republic international corporation reported the following consolidated results

the full year 2022 compared to 1 164 0 for 2021 solid underwriting results drove a consolidated combined ratio of 91 0 for the full year 2022 compared to 89 9 and 93 3 in 2021 and 2020 respectively for 2022 consolidated net premiums and fees earned declined 4 1 reflecting a decrease in title insurance of 13 0 offset by growth in general insurance of 7 1 conversely consolidated net premiums and fees for 2021 represented growth of 18 8 compared to 2020 with mid single digit increases in general insurance and significant growth in title insurance attributable to a low interest rate environment and a robust real estate market net investment income increased in 2022 following relatively flat levels maintained in 2021 the increase for 2022 reflects growth in the invested asset base and higher investment yields earned during 2022 the company returned total capital of 862 0 including 580 7 in dividends and 281 2 of share repurchases 12 6 million shares at an average price of 22 23 per share leaving approximately 169 0 remaining under the current repurchase authorization as of december 31 2022 following the close of the year and through february 23 2023 the company repurchased 1 3 million additional shares for 35 6 average price of 25 85 leaving 133 1 remaining under the current repurchase authorization book value per share was 21 05 as of december 31 2022 reflecting declining fair market values of the investment portfolio during the year partially offset by strong operating earnings with the addition of dividends declared during the year this was an increase of 0 9 over year end 2021 old republic s business is managed for the long run in this context management s key objectives are to achieve highly profitable operating results over the long term and to ensure balance sheet strength for the primary needs of the insurance subsidiaries underwriting and related services business in this view the evaluation of periodic and long term results excludes consideration of all investment gains losses under generally accepted accounting principles gaap however net income inclusive of investment gains losses is the measure of total profitability in management s opinion the focus on income excluding investment gains losses also described herein as segment pretax operating income provides a better way to analyze evaluate and establish accountability for the results of the insurance operations the inclusion of realized investment gains losses in net income can mask trends in operating results because such realizations are often highly discretionary similarly the inclusion of unrealized investment gains losses in equity securities can further distort such operating results with significant period to period fluctuations table_start financial highlights change

coverage high renewal retention ratios and new business production all contributed net investment income increased in 2022 reflecting higher investment yields earned and to a lesser extent growth in

improved in 2022 and 2021 inclusive of favorable reserve development from prior periods favorable development for both periods came predominantly from the commercial automobile and workers compensation lines of coverage the current period loss costs reflect several years of premium rate increases underwriting actions and a shift in the line of coverage mix the expense ratios generally reflect the shift in line of coverage mix investments in new products and geographies in recent years have diversified the general insurance business resulting in shifts in the lines of coverage mix toward lines with higher expense ratios and lower current period loss ratios together these factors produced highly profitable combined ratios and greater pretax operating income for the periods reported for general insurance we target combined ratios between 90 and 95 over a full underwriting cycle recognizing that quarterly and annual ratios and trends may deviate from this range

continue to face headwinds into 2023 the main driver of these trends is increasing mortgage interest rates which continue to drive a steep reduction in refinance activity and to a lesser extent purchase activity an uptick in commercial transaction activity resulted in commercial premium growth during the full year conversely title insurance net premiums and fees earned grew by 34 0 for 2021 attributable to a low interest rate environment and a robust real estate market increased revenue generated on purchase transactions was partially offset by a decline in refinance activity net investment income increased for 2022 reflecting growth in the invested asset base and higher investment yields earned for 2021 net investment income also reflected growth in the invested asset base however was somewhat offset by lower investment yields the 2022 title insurance loss ratio decreased slightly due predominantly to higher levels of favorable development as a percentage of premium the 2022 expense ratio was elevated compared to 2021 generally reflecting the combination of lower directly produced revenues that carry higher fixed expenses and to a lesser extent a greater proportion of agency produced revenues that have a higher overall expense ratio the 2022 full year expense ratio also reflects the impact of a fourth quarter state sales tax assessment payment of 17 2 0 5 percentage points for which the company is currently pursuing recovery title insurance s 2021 expense ratio reflects the benefit of greater leverage of the expense structure on significantly higher premium and fee volume tempered by an increased mix of agency produced revenues late in 2021 together these factors produced profitable combined ratios albeit lower pretax operating income for 2022

company had no fixed income investments in default as to principal and or interest several years ago interest rates dropped to a level where the company had the opportunity to invest in high quality dividend paying equity securities to attain a higher yield than could be earned from fixed income investments with similar risk profiles this equity portfolio grew to a high of more than 30 of the entire consolidated portfolio including a large amount of unrealized gains in early 2022 management decided to rebalance the portfolio and reduce its equity holdings this decision was precipitated by several factors the overall economic backdrop a rapidly increasing level of inflation the federal reserve signaling a tightening of monetary policy and increasing interest rates as a result the company replaced the yield that has been provided by the equity portfolio with a lower risk in terms of volatility source of net investment income the company sold more than 2 billion worth of equities all of which were within 11 of their 52 week highs this generated 374 5 in net realized gains on sales as part of a tax planning initiative the company took advantage of depressed fixed income values from the rising interest rate environment and sold enough fixed income securities in a loss position to offset all but 62 2 in net realized gains following the rebalancing at december 31 2022 the portfolio is comprised of 20 equities and 80 fixed income and short term investments these transactions along with the reinvestment of approximately 1 4 billion of maturities increased the ending fixed income portfolio yield from 2 40 as of december 31 2021 to 3 32 as of december 31 2022 short term maturity investment positions reflect a large variety of factors including current operating needs expected operating cash flows debt maturities and investment strategy considerations accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels short term investment levels were elevated at december 31 2022 due to the timing of reinvesting funds from sales of investments and the planned funding of the company s share repurchase program the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations with regard to its equity portfolio the company does not own any options nor does it engage in any type of option writing traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of the invested assets base the fixed income investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is reduced by concentrating on non callable issues and by taking asset liability matching considerations into account purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management practices is expected to produce a more stable fixed income investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the fair value of the company s fixed income investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the fixed income investment portfolio generally affects net unrealized gains or losses as a general rule rising interest rates enhance currently available yields but typically lead to a reduction in the fair value of existing fixed income investments by contrast a decline in such rates reduces currently available yields but usually serves to increase the fair value of the existing fixed income investment portfolio all such changes in fair value of securities are reflected net of deferred income taxes directly in the shareholders equity account and as a separate component of the statements of comprehensive income given the company s inability to forecast or control the movement of interest rates old republic sets the maturity spectrum of its fixed income securities portfolio within parameters of estimated liability payouts and focuses the overall portfolio on high quality investments by so doing old republic believes it is reasonably assured of its ability to hold securities to maturity as it may deem necessary in changing environments and of ultimately recovering their aggregate cost possible future declines in fair values for old republic s fixed income portfolio would

such reinsurance balances recoverable from non admitted foreign and certain other reinsurers such as captive insurance companies owned by assureds or business producers as well as similar balances or credits arising from policies that are retrospectively rated or subject to assureds high deductible retentions are substantially collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit securities and other financial instruments old republic evaluates on a regular basis the financial condition of its assuming reinsurers and assureds who purchase its retrospectively rated or high deductible policies allowances for estimated credit losses are recognized since reinsurance retrospectively rated and self insured deductible policies and contracts do not relieve old republic from its direct obligations to assureds or their beneficiaries old republic s reinsurance practices with respect to portions of its business also result from its desire to bring its sponsoring organizations and customers into some degree of joint venture or risk sharing relationship the company may in exchange for a ceding commission reinsure up to 100 of the underwriting risk and the premium applicable to such risk to commercial institutions generally whose customers are insured by old republic or individual customers who have formed captive insurance companies the ceding commissions received compensate old republic for performing the direct insurer s functions of underwriting actuarial claim settlement loss control legal reinsurance and administrative services to comply with local and federal regulations and for providing appropriate risk management services remaining portions of old republic s business are reinsured in most instances with independent insurance or reinsurance companies pursuant to excess of loss agreements except as noted in the following paragraph reinsurance protection on property and liability coverages generally limits the net loss from any one event to a maximum of 5 2 for workers compensation 7 0 for commercial automobile liability 7 0 for general liability 12 0 for executive protection directors officers and errors omissions 2 2 for aviation and 10 0 for property coverages title insurance risk assumptions are generally limited to a maximum of 500 0 as to any one policy the vast majority of title policies issued however carry exposures of less than 1 0 the average direct primary mortgage guaranty exposure is in whole dollars 37 000 per insured loan the company maintains treaty and facultative reinsurance coverage for its workers compensation exposures pursuant to regulatory requirements however all workers compensation primary insurers such as the company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits other than the substantial concentration of workers compensation losses caused by the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on america to the best of the company s knowledge there had not been a similar accumulation of claims in a single location from a single occurrence prior to that event nevertheless the possibility continues to exist that non reinsured losses could depending on a wide range of severity and frequency assumptions aggregate several hundred million dollars to an insurer such as the company such aggregation of losses could occur in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single facility such as a high rise building as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on america the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism primary insurers like the company thus became fully exposed to such claims late in 2002 the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 the tria was signed into law immediately establishing a temporary federal reinsurance program administered by the secretary of the treasury the program applied to insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from an act of terrorism as defined in the tria congress extended and modified the program in late 2005 through the terrorism risk insurance revision and extension act of 2005 the trirea trirea expired on december 31 2007 congress enacted a revised program in december 2007 through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act the tripra of 2007 the tripra has been extended on several occasions most recently on december 20 2019 for seven years the tria automatically voided all policy exclusions which were in effect for terrorism related losses and obligated insurers to offer terrorism coverage with most commercial property and casualty insurance lines the trirea revised the definition of property and casualty insurance to exclude commercial automobile burglary and theft surety professional liability and farm owners multi peril insurance tripra did not make any further changes to the definition of property and casualty insurance however it did include domestic acts of terrorism within the scope of the program although insurers are permitted to charge an additional premium for terrorism coverage insureds may reject the coverage under tripra the program s protection is not triggered for losses arising from an act of terrorism until the industry first suffers losses in excess of a prescribed aggregate deductible during any one year the program deductible trigger was 200 0 for 2022 once the program trigger is met the program will be responsible for a fixed percentage of the company s terrorism losses that exceed its deductible which ranges from 85 for 2015 and declined by one percentage point per year until it reached 80 in 2020 the company s deductible amounts to 20 of direct earned premium on eligible property and casualty insurance coverages the company currently reinsures limits on a treaty basis of 195 0 in excess of 5 0 for claims arising from certain acts of terrorism for casualty clash and catastrophe workers compensation liability insurance coverages the company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain accounts in excess of 200 0 to manage the company s net exposures table_start critical accounting estimates table_end the company s annual financial statements incorporate a large number and types of estimates relative to matters which are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made the estimation process required of an insurance enterprise such as old republic is by its very nature highly dynamic inasmuch as it necessitates a continuous evaluation analysis and quantification of factual data as it becomes known to the company as a result actual experienced outcomes can differ from the estimates made at any point in time and thus affect future periods reported revenues expenses net income or loss and financial condition changes in estimates generally result from altered circumstances the continuum of newly emerging information and its effect on past assumptions and judgments the effects of securities markets valuations and changes in inflation rates and future economic conditions beyond the company s control as a result old republic cannot predict quantify or guaranty the likely impact that probable changes in estimates will have on its future financial condition or results of operations old republic believes that its most critical accounting estimates relate to the establishment of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and the recoverability of reinsured outstanding losses the major assumptions and methods used in setting these estimates are summarized as follows a the establishment of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the company s reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses payable including incurred but not reported losses and loss adjustment expenses the establishment of loss reserves by the company s insurance subsidiaries is a reasonably complex and dynamic process influenced by a large variety of factors as further discussed below consequently reserves established are a reflection of the opinions of a large number of persons of the application and interpretation of historical precedent and trends of expectations as to future developments and of management s judgment in interpreting all such factors at any point in time the company is exposed to the possibility of higher or lower than anticipated loss costs and the resulting changes in estimates are recorded in operations of the periods during which they are made increases to prior reserve estimates are often referred to as unfavorable development whereas any changes that decrease previous estimates of the company s ultimate liability are referred to as favorable development most of old republic s consolidated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves stem from its general insurance business at december 31 2022 such reserves accounted for 94 3 and 90 7 of consolidated gross and net of reinsurance reserves respectively while similar reserves at december 31 2021 represented 93 7 and 90 2 of the respective consolidated amounts the company s reserve setting process reflects the nature of its insurance business and the operationally decentralized basis upon which it is conducted old republic s general insurance operations encompass a large variety of coverages or classes of predominantly commercial insurance it does not have a meaningful exposure to personal insurance coverages such as homeowners or private passenger automobile insurance consequently the wide variety of policies issued and commercial insurance customers served require that loss reserves be analyzed and established in the context of the unique or different attributes of each block or class of business produced by the company for example accident liability claims emanating from insured trucking companies or from general aviation customers become known relatively quickly whereas claims of a general liability nature arising from the building activities of a construction company may emerge over extended periods of time similarly claims filed pursuant to errors and omissions or directors and officers liability coverages are usually not prone to immediate evaluation or quantification inasmuch as many such claims may be litigated over several years and their ultimate costs may be affected by judge or jury verdicts approximately 89 of the general insurance s loss reserves stem from liability insurance coverages for commercial customers which typically require more extended periods of investigation and at times protracted litigation before they are finally settled as a consequence of these and other factors old republic does not utilize a single overarching loss reserving approach the company prepares periodic analyses of its loss reserve estimates for its significant insurance coverages it establishes point estimates for most losses on an insurance coverage line by line basis for individual subsidiaries sub classes individual accounts blocks of business or other unique concentrations of insurance risks such as directors and officers liability that have similar attributes actuarially or otherwise derived ranges of reserve levels are not utilized as such in setting these reserves instead the reported reserves encompass the company s best point estimates at each reporting date and the overall reserve level at any point in time therefore represents the compilation of a very large number of reported reserve estimates and the results of a variety of formula calculations largely driven by analysis of historical data favorable or unfavorable developments of prior year reserves are implicitly covered by the point estimates incorporated in total reserves at each balance sheet date the company does not project future variability or make an explicit provision for uncertainty when determining its best estimate of loss reserves over the most recent decade actual incurred losses have developed within a reasonable range of their original estimates aggregate loss reserves consist of liability estimates for claims that have been reported case to the company s insurance subsidiaries and reserves for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr or whose ultimate costs may not become fully apparent until a future time additionally the company establishes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves for loss settlement costs that are not directly related to individual claims such reserves are based on prior years cost experience and trends and are intended to cover the unallocated costs of claim departments administration of case and ibnr claims over time a large variety of statistical analyses and formula calculations are utilized to provide for ibnr claim costs as well as additional costs that can arise from such factors as monetary and social inflation changes in claims administration processes changes in reinsurance ceded and recoverability levels and expected trends in claim costs and related ratios typically such formulas take into account link ratios that represent prior years patterns of incurred or paid loss trends between succeeding years or past experience relative to progressions of the number of claims reported over time and ultimate average costs per claim overall reserves pertaining to several hundred large individual commercial insurance accounts that exhibit sufficient statistical credibility and at times may be subject to retrospective premium rating plans or the utilization of varying levels or types of self insured retentions through captive insurers and similar risk management mechanisms are established on an account by account basis using case reserves and applicable formula driven methods large account reserves are usually set and analyzed for groups of coverages such as workers compensation commercial automobile and general liability that are typically underwritten jointly for many customers for certain long tail categories of insurance such as retained or assumed excess liability or excess workers compensation officers and directors liability and commercial umbrella liability relative to which claim development patterns are particularly long more volatile and immature in their early stages of development the company judgmentally establishes the most current accident years loss reserves on the basis of expected loss ratios such expected loss ratios typically reflect currently estimated loss ratios from prior accident years adjusted for the effect of actual and anticipated rate changes actual and anticipated changes in coverage reinsurance mix of business and other anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs or the legal and claims environment expected loss ratios are generally used for the two to five most recent accident years depending on the individual class or category of business as actual claims data emerges in succeeding interim and annual periods the original accident year loss ratio assumptions are validated or otherwise adjusted sequentially through the application of statistical projection techniques such as the bornhuetter ferguson method which utilizes data from the more mature experience of prior years to arrive at a likely indication of more recent years loss trends and costs title insurance and related escrow services loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established as point estimates to cover the projected settlement costs of known as well as ibnr losses related to premium and escrow service revenues of each reporting period reserves for known claims are based on an assessment of the facts available to the company during the settlement process the point estimates covering all loss reserves take into account ibnr claims based on past experience and evaluations of such variables as changing trends in the types of policies issued changes in real estate markets and interest rate environments and changing levels of loan refinancing all of which can have a bearing on the emergence number and ultimate costs of claims rfig run off mortgage guaranty insurance reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are recognized only upon an instance of default defined as an insured mortgage loan for which two or more consecutive monthly payments have been missed loss reserves are based on statistical calculations that take into account the number of reported insured mortgage loan defaults as of each balance sheet date as well as experience based estimates of loan defaults that have occurred but have not as yet been reported further the loss reserve estimating process takes into account a large number of variables including trends in claim severity potential salvage recoveries expected cure rates for reported loan delinquencies at various stages of default the level of coverage rescissions and claims denials due to material misrepresentation in key underwriting information or non compliance with prescribed underwriting guidelines and management judgments relative to future employment levels housing market activity and mortgage loan interest costs demand and extensions the company has the legal right to rescind mortgage insurance coverage unilaterally as expressly stated in its policy moreover two federal courts that have considered that policy wording have each affirmed that right according to the policy if any of those representations are materially false or misleading with respect to a loan the company has the right to cancel or rescind coverage for that loan retroactively to commencement of the coverage as discussed above the reserves for losses and related loss adjustment expenses are based on a wide variety of factors and calculations among these the company believes the most critical are the establishment of expected loss ratios for at least the two to five most recent accident years particularly for long tail coverages as to which information about covered losses emerges and becomes more accurately quantifiable over long periods of time long tail coverages generally include workers compensation commercial automobile liability general liability errors and omissions and directors and officers liability as well as title insurance gross loss reserves related to such long tail coverages ranged between 94 1 and 94 6 and averaged 94 4 of gross consolidated loss reserves as of the three most recent year ends net of reinsurance recoverables such reserves ranged between 94 3 and 94 4 and averaged 94 4 as of the same dates loss trends that are considered when establishing the above noted expected loss ratios which take into account such variables as judgments and estimates relative to premium rate trends and adequacy current and expected interest rates current and expected social and economic inflation trends and insurance industry statistical claim trends the company applies these expected loss ratios to earned premiums when estimating the periodic reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses loss development factors expected claim rates and average claim costs all of which are based on company and or industry statistics may also be used to project reported and unreported losses for each accounting period volatility of reserve estimates and sensitivity there is a great deal of uncertainty in the estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and unanticipated events can have both a favorable or unfavorable impact on such estimates the company believes that the factors most responsible in varying and continually changing degrees for such favorable or unfavorable development are as follows general insurance net loss reserves can be affected by actual experience differing from expectations related to frequency of claims incurred but not reported the effect of reserve discounts applicable to certain workers compensation claims severity of litigated claims in particular governmental or judicially imposed retroactive conditions in the settlement of claims such as noted elsewhere in this document in regard to black lung disease claims inflation rates applicable to repairs and the medical benefits portion of claims and the emergence patterns applicable to certain types of claims such as those stemming from litigated assumed reinsurance or a e claims title insurance loss reserve levels can be impacted by such developments as loan refinancing activity the effect of which can be to change the expected period during which title policies remain exposed to loss emergence and changes in either property values or the volume of transactions which by virtue of the speculative nature of some real estate developments can lead to increased occurrences of fraud defalcations or mechanics liens rfig run off net loss reserve levels can be influenced by several factors including changes in the mix of insured business toward loans that have a higher or lower probability of default increases in the average risk per insured loan the levels of estimated rescission and claim denial activity the deterioration of regional or national economic conditions leading to a reduction in borrowers income and thus their ability to make payments on outstanding loans and changes in housing values and or in housing supply that can change the rate at which defaults evolve into claims and affect their overall severity with respect to old republic s small life and accident insurance operations reserve adequacy may be impacted by medical care cost inflation frequency and severity of claims and catastrophic events where we have concentrations of insured lives consolidated loss costs developed favorably in the three most recent calendar years this development had the consequent effect of reducing consolidated annual loss costs for the three most recent years within a range of 3 3 and 10 4 or by an average of approximately 7 3 per annum as a percentage of each of these years consolidated earned premiums and fees the favorable developments have ranged between 1 2 and 3 7 and have averaged 2 5 the consolidated cumulative development on prior year loss reserves over the past ten years through december 31 2022 has ranged from 4 1 favorable to 13 4 favorable and averaged 8 0 favorable approximately 600 based on current year ending reserves given the long tail associated with most of the company s lines of business this loss reserve development has occurred over many years the consolidated one year development on prior year loss reserves over the past ten years through december 31 2022 has ranged from 4 unfavorable to 5 0 favorable and averaged 2 1 favorable approximately 160 0 million based on current year ending reserves management does not have a practical business reason for making projections of likely outcomes of future loss developments its analysis and evaluation of old republic s existing business mix the natural offset effects of its diverse coverage current aggregate loss reserve levels and loss development patterns suggests these historical outcomes are illustrative of the reasonable likelihood of how 2022 year end loss reserves could ultimately develop the most significant factors impacting the potential reserve development for each of the company s insurance segments is discussed above the current analysis of loss development factors and economic conditions influencing the company s insurance coverages point to a position of reserve adequacy in management s opinion the other segments loss reserve development patterns most notably those associated with title and mortgage insurance show greater variability due to changes in economic conditions which cannot be reasonably anticipated consequently management believes that using the historical outcomes presented above provides a reasonable range of cumulative and one year reserve development for a sensitivity analysis of the company s consolidated reserves as of december 31 2022 b the recoverability of reinsured outstanding losses assets consisting of balance sheet date reserve estimates recoverable from assuming reinsurers in future periods as gross losses are settled and paid are established at the same time as the gross losses are recorded as reserves accordingly these assets are subject to the same estimation processes and valuations as the related gross amounts as is discussed above as of the three most recent year ends outstanding reinsurance recoverable balances ranged between 34 2 and 38 5 and averaged 36 3 of the related gross reserves see note 5 for further discussion regarding recoverability of the company s reinsurance balances table_start other information table_end reference is here made to information about segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating results liquidity and other performance indicators applicable to an insurance enterprise such as old republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years in addition to the factors cited below the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed and other claims can have a bearing on period to period comparisons and future operating results some of the oral or written statements made in the company s reports press releases and conference calls following earnings releases can constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 any such forward looking statements involve assumptions uncertainties and risks that may affect the company s future performance with regard to old republic s general insurance segment its results can be particularly affected by the level of market competition which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors the levels of investment yields and inflation rates and periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses work related injuries and unanticipated external events title insurance and rfig run off results can be affected by similar factors and by changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of mortgage loans employment trends and default rates on mortgage loans life and accident insurance earnings can be affected by the levels of employment and consumer spending changes in mortality and health trends and alterations in policy lapsation rates at the parent holding company level operating earnings or losses are generally reflective of the amount of debt outstanding and its cost interest income on temporary holdings

         "item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four major segments namely its general property and liability coverages title mortgage guaranty and life insurance groups changes in accounting policies in 1993 the company adopted several changes in accounting policies to comply with financial accounting standards board fasb pronouncements that have been mandated the adoption of the asset and liability method for calculating deferred income taxes and the recognition of present value liabilities pertaining to post retirement health benefits under retirement plans maintained by a few old republic subsidiaries increased net income by 8 6 or 15 cents per share 14 cents fully diluted in the first quarter of 1993 accounting for reinsurance ceded transactions affected the company s balance sheet but not the consolidated income statement assets and liabilities at december 31 1993 were increased by corresponding amounts of approximately 1 524 2 due to the reclassification change for these transactions finally the company reexamined the classification of its invested assets which led to reporting such assets as either held to maturity or available for sale the effect of these classification changes was to increase assets and the liability for deferred taxes by 25 2 and 8 7 respectively and common shareholders equity for the net unrealized appreciation of securities newly reclassified at fair value by 16 4 or 32 cents per common share as of december 31 1993 see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details relating to these changes prior years financial statements have not been restated nor reclassified to reflect these changes as permitted by the pertinent fasb pronouncements financial position exclusive of the classification changes noted above old republic s financial position at december 31 1993 reflected increases in assets of 9 8 liabilities of 8 6 and common shareholders equity of 13 5 when compared to the immediately preceding year end at december 31 1993 and 1992 cash and invested assets represented 81 2 and 80 5 of consolidated assets respectively relatively high short term maturity investment positions were maintained as of the most recent year ends to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and to enhance flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including seasonal operating cash needs investment strategy and expectations as to trends in interest yields accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the dynamics of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 1993 and 1992 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities the corporation has not directed its investable funds to so called junk bonds during 1993 however old republic increased its commitment to common stock investments which reflected an increase of 50 vis a vis the related invested balance at year end 1992 as of december 31 1993 the carrying value of fixed maturity securities in default as to principal or interest was immaterial in relation to consolidated assets or shareholders equity consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years the parent holding company has met its liquidity and capital needs for the past three years through dividends paid by its subsidiaries and through the issuance of debt and equity securities the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled additionally the terms of guarantees by the company of bank loans to the trustee of the company s employees savings and stock ownership plan require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and restrict the amount of debt the company may incur both of which covenants are being met in august 1992 the company issued 110 of 5 3 4 convertible debentures maturing in 2002 net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem approximately 50 of commercial paper debt with the remainder allocated to the capital of several insurance subsidiaries convertible debt of approximately 41 3 outstanding at december 31 1991 was converted into 2 676 284 shares of old republic common stock during 1992 page old republic s capitalization of 1 617 7 at december 31 1993 consisted of debt and debt equivalents of 282 7 redeemable convertible preferred stock of 16 6 excluding 15 1 of such stock classified as a debt equivalent conver tible preferred stock of 3 9 cumulative preferred stock of 57 5 and common shareholders equity of 1 256 9 the rise in the common shareholders equity account during the past three years reflects primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares the conversion of debt and preferred stock to common stock and the previously noted net unrealized appreciation of securities results of operations revenues net premiums and fees earned increased by 12 16 and 10 in 1993 1992 and 1991 respectively for each of the past three years property and liability insurance premium increases were due to varying levels of growth in certain parts of the company s business but principally among liability coverages during these years the corporation has cancelled periodically certain property and liability insurance business not meeting its underwriting expectations greater real estate financing activity during the three most recent calendar years led to higher revenues in the title segment for the past three years mortgage guaranty premiums also increased due to a rise in the amount of renewal and new business and greater market penetration life and disability premium volume has generally trended down during the years 1992 and 1991 as the corporation has continued to de emphasize this business until greater returns are possible an increase in 1993 of life and disability premium is attributed to the introduction of more favorably priced term life insurance products that received greater market acceptance net investment income was relatively flat in 1993 and grew by 1 and 6 in 1992 and 1991 respectively for each of the past three years the growth in this revenue source was bolstered by positive consolidated operating cash flows and a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities the average annual yield on investments was 6 4 7 3 and 8 1 for the years ended december 31 1993 1992 and 1991 respectively the downward trend reflects principally the declining current yields in the securities markets while the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize capital gains during 1992 such gains were much higher than those realized in 1993 and 1991 dispositions of securities have been caused principally by 1 calls prior to maturity by issuers 2 a desire to reduce investments in tax exempt securities 3 a desire to extend moderately the average life of the portfolio and 4 the company s ongoing process of continually monitoring its investments with a view toward maximizing the quality ratings and diversification of its portfolio for the year 1993 approximately 58 of total dispositions represented maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the year 1992 these amounted to approximately 37 of all securities sales and dispositions expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 56 in 1993 58 in 1992 and 62 in 1991 this consolidated ratio was affected principally by a slightly improving claim ratio for property and liability insurance coverages in the most recent three years the corporation s property and liability insurance subsidiaries along with other companies in the industry have also sustained higher loss assessments for residual market assigned risk business policyholders dividends incurred in the corporation s property and liability lines for each year reflect changes in the loss ratio for experience rated policies the title insurance loss ratio was affected by higher than normal claims provisions in both 1993 and 1992 which added approximately 3 0 and 3 8 respectively to this group s loss ratio the loss ratio declined or remained relatively stable in the mortgage guaranty insurance line due to a reduction of frequency of claim occurrences the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 45 in 1993 46 in 1992 and 43 in 1991 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business in years during which title insurance premiums and fees grow significantly as in 1993 and 1992 in particular the consolidated expense ratio tends to rise as production costs for this line are higher than those for most other types of insurance page income from operations during 1992 the company s title insurance group established greater than normal loss provisions of 15 0 as additional funding for various title escrow claims in process of disposition in 1992 the company s life insurance subsidiaries recorded previously unrecognized tax recoveries of 1 1 and related interest credits of approximately 12 4 stemming from resolution of various long standing internal revenue service disputes applicable to taxable years 1969 to 1981 these charges and credits served to increase consolidated revenues by 12 4 and claim costs by 15 0 and to record net current and deferred income tax credits of 1 1 above normal additions to title insurance group claim reserves during 1993 affected adversely pre tax income by approximately 13 3 income before taxes decreased by 3 in 1993 and increased by 43 in 1992 and 32 in 1991 general insurance results have trended up slightly during the past five years and have continued as the major contributor to consolidated earnings principally as a result of growing investment income title insurance operating results have improved over the past three years due to the previously discussed increase in revenues the mortgage guaranty segment reflected significantly improved results due to increased revenues and favorable claims experience in each of the past three years while life and disability operations have reflected a secular downward trend in the past three years consolidated pre tax income for 1993 and 1992 in particular was affected positively by greater than normal realization of investment gains the effective consolidated income tax rates were 32 in 1993 30 in 1992 and 26 in 1991 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax exempt investment income on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand in august 1993 the corporate federal income tax rate was increased from 34 to 35 retroactive to january 1 1993 in recent years the corporation has emphasized purchases of taxable investment securities amortization of fresh start benefits stemming from the tax reform act of 1986 the tra reduced income taxes by 1 9 in 1992 and 3 6 in 1991 the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 the rra provided for a number of changes affecting the taxation of the corporation and a number of its subsidiaries among such changes are acceleration in the recognition of salvage and subrogation recoveries and deferral of costs associated with the production of life and disability business and the subsequent amortization of those costs the tra also provided for a number of changes affecting the taxation of the corporation and a number of its subsidiaries among such changes are reductions in corporate tax rates the discounting of loss reserves the acceleration of premium income recognition and the inclusion in taxable income of a portion of certain tax exempt investment income previously not subject to tax in addition the tra calls for the calculation of an alternative minimum tax the rra and tra are likely to result in accelerated payment of federal income taxes however most of the additional tax payments are treated as timing differences for financial accounting purposes consequently such payments are expected to have minimal effects on consolidated results of operations and financial position determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating results liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as the corporation are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes

         " item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four major segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups changes in accounting policies in 1993 the company adopted several changes in accounting policies to comply with financial accounting standards board fasb pronouncements the resulting adoption of the asset and liability method for calculating deferred income taxes and the recognition of present value liabilities pertaining to post retirement health benefits under retirement plans maintained by a few old republic subsidiaries increased net income by 8 6 or 15 cents per share 14 cents fully diluted in the first quarter of 1993 the company also reexamined the classification of its invested assets which led to reporting such assets as either held to maturity or available for sale the effect of these classification changes was to increase assets and the liability for deferred taxes by 25 2 and 8 7 respectively and common shareholders equity for the net unrealized appreciation of securities newly reclassified at fair value by 16 4 or 32 cents per common share as of december 31 1993 in november 1995 the company reevaluated the classification of invested assets as permitted by a special report issued by the fasb in november 1995 as a result the company reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale certain fixed maturity securities with an amortized cost of 1 365 7 fair value of 1 394 2 and an unrealized gain of 28 4 the unrealized gain net of deferred income taxes of 9 9 has been credited directly to a separate account in the common shareholders equity section of the balance sheet in the final quarter of 1995 see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details relating to these changes as permitted by the pertinent fasb pronouncements prior years financial statements have not been restated nor reclassified to reflect these changes in the fourth quarter of 1995 the company s mortgage guaranty group adopted the accrual method for recording past due premium revenues and the related premium receivable arising from new monthly premium policies this new payment mode has emerged as a significant factor for the mortgage guaranty industry since mid 1994 before adoption of this accrual method past due premiums were recognized on receipt of cash with the adoption of this accrual method a cumulative increase in net premiums written of 9 8 million net premiums earned of 6 3 million and post tax income of 3 9 million or 6 cents per fully diluted share was reflected in the company s final quarter and the year of 1995 financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 1995 reflected increases in assets of 5 3 liabilities of 1 0 and common shareholders equity of 21 3 when compared to the immediately preceding year end at december 31 1995 and 1994 cash and invested assets represented 67 0 and 62 4 of consolidated assets respectively relatively high short term investment positions were maintained as of the most recent year ends to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including seasonal operating cash needs investment strategy and expectations as to trends in interest yields accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the dynamics of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 1995 and 1994 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities in the latter regard old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities the corporation has not directed its investable funds to so called junk bonds or derivative types of securities during 1995 old republic s commitment to equity securities decreased by 52 2 vis a vis the related invested balance at year end 1994 as of december 31 1995 the carrying value of fixed maturity securities in default as to principal or interest was immaterial in relation to consolidated assets or shareholders equity page consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years the decline in cash flow from operations in 1994 was due mainly to a substantial drop in title segment revenues and profitability and a small decline in property and liability insurance premiums the parent holding company has met its liquidity and capital needs for the past three years through dividends paid by its subsidiaries and through the issuance of debt the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled additionally the terms of guarantees by the company of bank loans to the trustee of the company s employees savings and stock ownership plan require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and restrict the amount of debt the company may incur both of which covenants are being met old republic s capitalization of 2 005 6 at december 31 1995 consisted of debt and debt equivalents of 320 5 redeemable convertible preferred stock of 17 0 excluding 11 7 of such stock classified as a debt equivalent convertible preferred stock of 6 cumulative preferred stock of 54 8 and common shareholders equity of 1 612 5 the rise in the common shareholders equity account during the past three years reflects primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares the conversion of preferred stock to common stock and an increase during 1995 in the carrying value of fixed maturity and equity securities stated at fair value the corporation acquired 9 and 8 5 of common stock in 1995 and 1994 respectively and 2 6 of cumulative preferred stock in 1994 in open market transactions as of year end 1995 a standing authorization by the company s board of directors permits old republic to reacquire additional amounts of such shares for a total of up to 38 0 through may 1996 in february 1996 the company called for redemption its 10 debentures of 2018 74 0 million principal amount and its 5 75 convertible subordinated debentures of 2002 110 0 million principal amount redemption of the former will be effected with available funds while the latter are expected to be converted into approximately 4 3 million old republic common shares as a result of these expected redemptions and conversions the company s debt will decline by 184 0 million while its common shareholders equity account will rise by 110 0 million these transactions are not expected to have a material effect on old republic s 1996 earnings later in 1996 the company may at its sole option redeem all or part of approximately 54 8 million of its series h cumulative preferred stock and 29 6 million principal amount of its 11 5 debentures maturing in 2015 results of operations revenues net premiums and fees earned decreased by 3 5 and 1 6 in 1995 and 1994 and increased by 11 9 in 1993 in 1993 property and liability insurance premium increases were due to varying levels of growth in certain parts of the company s business but principally among liability coverages in 1994 and 1995 lower property and liability premium growth was due to a continuation of a soft premium rate environment for most insurance coverages and lower participation in involuntary market pools for the past three years mortgage guaranty premiums have increased due to a rise in the amount of renewal and new business and market expansion depressed conditions in the large california housing market and much lower refinancing activity nationwide resulted in reduced title insurance revenues in 1995 and 1994 greater housing and mortgage refinancing activity during 1993 had led to higher revenues in the title segment life and disability premium volume increased moderately during the last three years as a result of greater term life and accident insurance production net investment income grew by 10 7 and 3 1 in 1995 and 1994 and was relatively flat in 1993 for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows and a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities the average annual yield on investments was 6 2 6 1 and 6 4 for the years ended december 31 1995 1994 and 1993 respectively this yield pattern reflects at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio and changes in interest rates at various times during the past three years while the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize realized investment gains such gains were higher in 1995 and 1993 than those realized in 1994 dispositions of securities have been page caused principally by calls prior to maturity by issuers and by sales of equity securities in 1995 approximately 59 of total fixed maturity securities dispositions represented contractual maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the year 1994 these amounted to approximately 64 expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 54 in 1995 53 in 1994 and 56 in 1993 this consolidated ratio was affected principally by an improving claim ratio for liability insurance coverages through 1993 the corporation s property and liability insurance subsidiaries along with other companies in the industry sustained higher loss assessments for residual market assigned risk business in 1995 and 1994 provisions for such assessments declined as a result of the aforementioned reduction in residual market participations by the company s subsidiaries and by moderately improving premium rates for workers compensation insurance additionally old republic s general insurance results for 1994 benefitted from improved underwriting performance in its property and other non liability lines due to lower loss ratios policyholders dividends incurred mainly for the corporation s workers compensation insurance coverages for each year reflect changes in the loss ratio for individual experience rated policies the loss ratio rose in 1995 and 1994 in the mortgage guaranty insurance line due to a rise in frequency of claim occurrences mostly in the california market which has been affected by an economic slowdown for the past several years the title insurance loss ratio in 1995 and 1994 was affected by favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 while higher than normal claim provisions in 1993 added approximately 3 percentage points to this group s loss ratio the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 44 in 1995 47 in 1994 and 45 in 1993 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business during the past three years the property and liability expense ratio has remained relatively flat and that of the mortgage guaranty segment has been declining moderately the title insurance expense ratio was higher in 1994 and 1995 as premiums and fees volume in this segment declined at a faster rate than operating costs pre tax and net income income before taxes decreased by 7 and 3 in 1994 and 1993 respectively and increased by 40 in 1995 general insurance results have trended up during the past five years and have continued as the largest contributor to consolidated earnings principally as a result of greater investment income in 1995 and 1994 however improved earnings in this segment were also affected favorably by better underwriting results the mortgage guaranty segment reflected significantly improved earnings in each of the last three years due to increased revenues and as noted above a declining expense ratio title insurance operating results were much reduced in 1995 and 1994 due to the previously noted decline in revenues while they increased in 1993 as a result of much greater mortgage refinancing activity life and disability operations have posted relatively flat earnings in the past three years consolidated pre tax income for 1995 and 1993 was also affected positively by greater than normal realization of investment gains the effective consolidated income tax rates were 33 in 1995 and 1994 and 32 in 1993 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax exempt investment income on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand in august 1993 the corporate federal income tax rate was increased from 34 to 35 retroactive to january 1 1993 other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating results liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as the company are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims are some of the factors which have a bearing on quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons and future operating results page ",

         "item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four major segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups changes in accounting policies in november 1995 the company reevaluated the classification of invested assets as permitted by a special report issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb during that month as a result the company reclassified from the held to maturity to the available for sale categories certain fixed maturity securities with an amortized cost of 1 365 7 fair value of 1 394 2 and an unrealized gain of 28 4 the unrealized gain net of deferred income taxes of 9 9 was credited directly to a separate account in the common shareholders equity section of the balance sheet in the final quarter of 1995 in the fourth quarter of 1995 the company s mortgage guaranty group adopted the accrual method for recording past due premium revenues and the related premium receivable arising from new monthly premium policies this new payment mode emerged as a significant factor for the mortgage guaranty industry beginning in mid 1994 before adoption of this accrual method such past due premiums were recognized on receipt of cash with the adoption of this accrual method a cumulative increase in net premiums written of 9 8 net premiums earned of 6 3 and post tax income of 3 9 or 4 cents per fully diluted share was reflected in the company s final quarter and the year of 1995 financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 1996 reflected an increase in assets of 1 0 a decrease in liabilities of 3 5 and an increase in common shareholders equity of 17 8 when compared to the immediately preceding year end as indicated below the largest changes in the liabilities and equity accounts were due to debt redemptions and conversions respectively cash and invested assets represented 67 9 and 67 0 of consolidated assets as of december 31 1996 and 1995 respectively relatively high short term maturity investment positions continued to be maintained as of most recent year ends to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and to enhance flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including seasonal operating cash needs investment strategy and expectations as to trends in interest yields accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the dynamics of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 1996 and 1995 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities with an emphasis on tax exempt bonds old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities the corporation has not directed its investable funds to so called junk bonds or derivative types of securities during 1996 old republic s commitment to equity securities decreased by 8 0 vis a vis the related invested balance at year end 1995 as of december 31 1996 the carrying value of fixed maturity securities in default as to principal or interest was immaterial in relation to consolidated assets or shareholders equity consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years the decline in cash flow from operations in 1996 was due mainly to lower operating cash flow in old republic s general and life insurance segments the parent holding company has met its liquidity and capital needs for the past three years through dividends paid by its subsidiaries the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled additionally the terms of guarantees by the company of bank loans to the trustee of the company s employees savings and stock ownership plan require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and restrict the amount of debt the company may incur both of which covenants are being met 19 page old republic s capitalization of 2 074 6 at december 31 1996 consisted of debt and debt equivalents of 154 0 redeemable convertible preferred stock of 19 3 excluding 8 8 of such stock classified as a debt equivalent convertible preferred stock of 1 2 and common shareholders equity of 1 900 0 the increase in the common shareholders equity account during the past three years reflects primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares the issuance of additional shares to effect the debt conversions noted below and the conversion of preferred stock to common stock this was offset to some degree in 1996 by a decline compared to an increase in 1995 in the value of fixed maturity securities carried at market value the corporation acquired 9 of common stock in 1995 in open market transactions at its may 16 1996 meeting the company s board of directors authorized the reacquisition of up to 150 0 of common and preferred shares as market conditions warrant during the twenty four month period from that date in february 1996 the company called for redemption its 10 debentures maturing in 2018 75 0 principal amount and its 5 75 convertible subordinated debentures maturing in 2002 110 0 principal amount in april 1996 the company called for redemption its 11 5 debentures maturing in 2015 30 0 principal amount redemption of the debentures was effected with internally available funds while the subordinated debentures were converted by their terms into approximately 6 4 million old republic common shares as a result of these redemptions and conversions the company s debt declined by 215 0 while its common shareholders equity account rose by 108 6 the early retirement of the debentures produced a net of tax charge of 4 4 5 cents per share that has been reflected as an extraordinary item in 1996 in december 1996 the company redeemed all 54 8 of its series h cumulative preferred stock with available funds results of operations revenues net premiums and fees earned increased by 9 7 in 1996 and decreased by 3 5 and 1 6 in 1995 and 1994 respectively in 1996 the increase in property and liability earned premiums was 1 9 as premium growth continued at a slow pace due to a soft pricing environment in 1995 and 1994 lower property and liability premium growth was also due to the soft premium rate environment for most insurance coverages and lower participation in involuntary market assigned risk pools for the past three years mortgage guaranty premiums have increased due to a rise in the amount of renewal and new business and market expansion title group premiums and fee revenues increased 20 3 in 1996 greater housing and mortgage finance activity were the main reasons for this rise in revenues depressed conditions in the large california housing market and much lower refinancing activity nationwide resulted in reduced title insurance revenues in 1995 and 1994 life and disability premium volume increased moderately during the last three years as a result of greater term life and accident insurance production net investment income grew by 3 4 10 7 and 3 1 in 1996 1995 and 1994 respectively for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows and by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities in 1996 the company as previously mentioned used internal funds to refund most of the above noted 105 0 of debt and 54 8 of preferred stock thus reducing its invested asset base the average annual yield on investments was 6 0 6 2 and 6 1 for the years ended december 31 1996 1995 and 1994 respectively this yield pattern reflects at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio changes in interest rates at various times during the past three years and during 1995 and 1996 the commitment of a larger percentage of investable funds to tax exempt fixed maturity securities that typically bear lower yields while the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize realized investment gains such gains were higher in 1995 than those realized in 1996 and 1994 dispositions of securities have been caused principally by calls prior to maturity by issuers of bonds and notes and by sales of equity securities in 1996 approximately 72 5 of total fixed maturity securities dispositions represented contractual maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the year 1995 and 1994 these amounted to approximately 58 5 and 63 5 respectively 20 page expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 49 9 in 1996 54 4 in 1995 and 53 5 in 1994 this consolidated ratio was affected principally by an improving claim ratio for liability insurance coverages due mostly to reduced losses from involuntary workers compensation pool assessments as well as reduced claim frequencies and severity generally policyholders dividends incurred mainly for the corporation s workers compensation insurance coverages for each year reflect changes in the loss ratio for individual experience rated policies the loss ratio rose in each of the past three years in the mortgage guaranty insurance line due to a rise in frequency of claim occurrences mostly in the california market which has been affected by an economic slowdown for the past several years the title insurance loss ratio in each of the past three years was affected by favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 46 0 in 1996 44 0 in 1995 and 47 0 in 1994 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business during the past three years the property and liability expense ratio has remained relatively flat and that of the mortgage guaranty segment has been trending down the title insurance expense ratio was lower in 1996 due in part to an increase in premium and fees volume while it was higher in 1994 and 1995 as premiums and fees volume in this segment declined at a faster rate than operating costs could be reduced in 1996 interest and other charges declined principally as a result of the above noted reduction in outstanding debt pre tax and net income income before taxes increased by 8 3 and 39 9 in 1996 and 1995 respectively and decreased by 7 2 in 1994 general insurance results have trended up during the past five years and have continued as the largest contributor to consolidated earnings principally as a result of greater investment income and improved underwriting results the mortgage guaranty segment reflected significantly improved earnings in each of the last three years due to increased revenues title insurance earnings were much reduced in 1995 and 1994 due to the previously noted decline in revenues while the increase in 1996 resulted from growth in premiums and fees and a reduction in loss and expense ratios life and disability operations have posted relatively flat earnings in the past three years consolidated pre tax income for 1995 was also affected positively by greater than normal realization of investment gains the effective consolidated income tax rates were 31 6 in 1996 32 7 in 1995 and 32 5 in 1994 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax exempt investment income on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand see last paragraph under financial position above for extraordinary charge recorded in 1996 other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating results liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as the company are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims are some of the factors which have a bearing on quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons and future operating results 21 page ",

         " item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four major segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups change in accounting policy the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 128 fas 128 earnings per share in february 1997 this statement has been adopted by old republic and prior period data has been restated for comparative purposes fas 128 establishes a new methodology for computing earnings per share primary earnings per share is replaced by basic earnings per share the latter excludes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share per fas 128 is computed in a fashion similar to the former fully diluted earnings per share as required by prior authoritative fasb pronouncements non recurring items in the second quarter of 1997 several life insurance subsidiaries recovered income taxes and related accumulated interest due to favorable resolution with the internal revenue service of various outstanding issues pertaining to income tax returns for the years 1979 through 1982 these cash recoveries net of miscellaneous charges increased other income by 12 6 reduced income tax expense by 5 9 and increased after tax consolidated earnings by 14 2 0 10 per diluted common share for the year ended december 31 1997 financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 1997 reflected increases in assets liabilities and common shareholders equity of 4 0 0 7 and 13 3 respectively when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 69 6 and 67 9 of consolidated assets as of december 31 1997 and december 31 1996 respectively relatively high short term maturity investment positions continued to be maintained as of most recent year ends to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and to enhance flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including seasonal operating cash needs investment strategy and expectations as to trends in interest yields accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the dynamics of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 1997 and 1996 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities with an emphasis on tax exempt bonds old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities the corporation has not directed its investable funds to so called junk bonds or derivative types of securities old republic s commitment to equity securities during 1997 was approximately equal to the related invested balance at year end 1996 at december 31 1997 the company had no investments in default as to principal and or interest the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations old republic employs traditional investment management tools and techniques to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through adequate diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues and through asset liability matching practices purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management tenets generally provides 19 page a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially effected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold with a market value of 4 316 1 the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of 5 1 years and an indicated duration of 4 2 this implies that a 100 basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately 4 2 or 180 with regard to its 113 8 common stock portfolio the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing a 10 decrease in the u s equity market prices could result in a decrease of 11 4 in the market value of the company s common stock portfolio these possible declines in values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the common shareholders equity at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as long as operating cash flow and the ongoing emergence of bond maturities continued to provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years the 1996 decline in cash flow from operations was due mainly to lower operating cash flow in old republic s general and life segments each of the company s four segments contributed to the increase in such cash flow for 1997 the parent holding company has met its liquidity and capital needs principally through dividends paid by its subsidiaries the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled additionally the terms of guarantees by the company of bank loans to the trustee of the company s employees savings and stock ownership plan restrict the amount of debt the company may incur this covenant is being met old republic s capitalization of 2 296 1 at december 31 1997 consisted of debt and debt equivalents of 142 9 convertible preferred stock of 1 0 and common shareholders equity of 2 152 1 the increase in the common shareholders equity account during the past three years reflects primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares the conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock in 1997 the issuance of additional shares to effect a debt conversion in 1996 and an increase during 1997 and 1995 compared to a decrease during 1996 in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value common shareholders equity increases in 1997 were partially offset by the acquisition of 62 1 of common stock in open market transactions at its may 16 1996 meeting the company s board of directors had authorized the reacquisition of up to 150 0 of common and preferred shares as market conditions would warrant during the twenty four month period from that date as of december 31 1997 a total of 33 1 remained unutilized in february 1996 the company called for the redemption of its 10 debentures maturing in 2018 75 0 principal amount and its 5 75 convertible subordinated debentures maturing in 2002 110 0 principal amount in april 1996 the company called for the redemption of its 11 5 debentures maturing in 2015 30 0 principal amount redemption of these debentures was financed with internally available funds while the subordinated debentures were converted by their terms into approximately 9 6 million old republic common shares as a result of these redemptions and conversions the company s debt declined by 215 0 while its common shareholders equity account rose by 108 6 during 1996 the early retirement of the debentures produced a net of tax charge of 4 4 0 03 per diluted common share that has been reflected as an extraordinary item in 1996 in december 1996 the company redeemed all 54 8 of its series h cumulative preferred stock with available funds during the second quarter of 1997 the company issued 115 0 of 7 debentures maturing june 15 2007 proceeds from this offering were used principally to redeem commercial paper debt common share data has been retroactively adjusted to reflect a 50 stock dividend of the company s common shares approved by the board of directors on march 12 1998 fas 128 requires this stock dividend be reflected in the 1997 year end financial statements 20 page results of operations revenues consolidated net premiums and fees earned increased by 8 0 in 1997 and 9 7 in 1996 while they declined by 3 5 in 1995 property and liability earned premiums increased 4 5 in 1997 and 1 9 in 1996 and decreased by 1 5 in 1995 premium production trends in the past three years were affected by a soft pricing environment for most insurance coverages and by lower participation in involuntary market assigned risk pools growth in mortgage guaranty premiums for the past three years was enhanced principally by a rise in the amount of renewal business by territorial expansion and by relatively strong mortgage lending activity title group premiums and fee revenues increased 9 4 in 1997 and 20 3 in 1996 but decreased by 20 6 in 1995 greater housing and mortgage finance activity were the main reasons for this rise in revenues in the most recent two years depressed conditions in the large california housing market and much lower refinancing activity nationwide resulted in reduced title insurance revenues in 1995 life and disability premium volume increased moderately during the last three years as a result of greater term life and accident insurance production net investment income grew by 3 9 3 4 and 10 7 in 1997 1996 and 1995 respectively for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows and by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities the company as previously mentioned used internal funds in 1997 for open market purchases of its common stock and in 1996 to redeem certain debt and preferred stock thus reducing the size and earning power of its invested asset base the average annual yield on investments was 5 9 6 0 and 6 2 for the years ended december 31 1997 1996 and 1995 respectively this yield pattern reflects at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio changes in interest rates at various times during the past three years and the commitment of a larger percentage of investable funds to tax exempt fixed maturity securities that typically bear lower pre tax yields while the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize realized investment gains such gains were higher in 1995 than those realized in 1997 and 1996 dispositions of securities have been caused principally by calls prior to maturity by issuers of bonds and notes and by sales of equity securities in 1997 76 9 of total fixed maturity securities dispositions represented contractual maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the year 1996 and 1995 these amounted to 72 5 and 58 5 respectively expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 48 4 in 1997 49 9 in 1996 and 54 4 in 1995 this consolidated ratio was affected principally by an improving claim ratio for liability insurance coverages due mostly to reduced losses from involuntary workers compensation pool assessments as well as reduced claim frequencies and severity generally the loss ratio for mortgage guaranty insurance decreased slightly in 1997 compared to 1996 which increased compared to 1995 the 1996 increase was mostly due to a rise in frequency of claim occurrences principally in the california market which has been affected by an economic slowdown for several years the title insurance loss ratio in each of the past three years was affected by favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 45 2 in 1997 46 0 in 1996 and 44 0 in 1995 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business during the past three years the property and liability and mortgage guaranty segments expense ratios have remained relatively flat the title insurance expense ratio has trended lower particularly in 1997 due in part to an increase in premium and fees volume without a proportional increase in expenses the decline in interest and other charges particularly in 1997 is principally a result of the above noted reduction in outstanding debt the company and its subsidiaries have been aware for several years of issues associated with programming codes in existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches the company s subsidiaries are scheduled to complete by december 31 1998 the identification and implementation of changes and the testing of systems affected by this year 2000 issue the costs of identifying implementing and testing the required changes has not been material to historical operating results a significant portion of these costs was not incremental as the company and its subsidiaries have mostly utilized existing resources 21 page pre tax and net income income before taxes increased by 24 6 8 3 and 39 9 in 1997 1996 and 1995 respectively general insurance results have trended up during the past three years and have continued as the largest contributor to consolidated earnings principally as a result of improved underwriting results and greater investment income the mortgage guaranty segment reflected significantly improved earnings in each of the last three years due to increased revenues generating higher income from underwriting operations increases in title insurance earnings in 1997 and 1996 resulted from growth in premiums and fees and a reduction in loss and expense ratios while the lower results in 1995 were due to the previously noted decline in revenues life and disability operations excluding the aforementioned non recurring tax recovery item have posted relatively flat earnings in the past three years the effective consolidated income tax rates were 30 3 in 1997 31 6 in 1996 and 32 7 in 1995 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax exempt investment income on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand the lower rate in 1997 was also caused by the above noted income tax recoveries for prior years see last paragraph under financial position above for extraordinary charge recorded in 1996 other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating results liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as old republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years in addition to the factors cited in the next paragraph the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims all have a bearing on period to period comparisons and future operating results any forward looking statements contained in this report of necessity involve assumptions uncertainties and risks that may affect the company s future performance with regard to old republic s general insurance segment its results can be affected in particular by the level of market competition which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors the levels of interest and inflation rates as well as periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses and work related injuries mortgage guaranty and title insurance results can be affected by such factors as changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of mortgage loans employment trends and default rates on mortgage loans mortgage guaranty results may also be affected by various risk sharing arrangements with business producers life and disability insurance results can be impacted by the levels of employment and consumer spending as well as mortality and health trends at the holding company level results are generally affected by the amount of debt outstanding and its cost any forward looking statements speak only as of their dates old republic undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise such statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise and accordingly they may not be unduly relied upon 22 page ",

         "item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four major segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups non recurring items in the second quarter of 1997 several life insurance subsidiaries recovered income taxes and related accumulated interest due to favorable resolution with the internal revenue service of various outstanding issues pertaining to income tax returns for the years 1979 through 1982 these cash recoveries net of miscellaneous charges increased other income by 12 6 reduced income tax expense by 5 9 and increased after tax consolidated earnings by 14 2 0 10 per diluted common share for the year ended december 31 1997 financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 1998 reflected increases in assets and common shareholders equity of 1 4 and 7 1 respectively and a decrease in liabilities of 1 2 when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 70 5 and 69 6 of consolidated assets as of december 31 1998 and 1997 respectively relatively high short term maturity investment positions are generally maintained to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and to enhance flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including seasonal operating cash needs investment strategy and expectations as to trends in interest yields accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the dynamics of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 1998 and 1997 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities with an emphasis on tax exempt bonds old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities investable funds have not been directed to so called junk bonds or types of securities categorized as derivatives old republic s commitment to equity securities during 1998 increased by 40 7 vis a vis the related invested balance at year end 1997 at december 31 1998 the company had no investments in default as to principal and or interest the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations old republic employs traditional investment management tools and techniques to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through adequate diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues and through asset liability matching practices purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management tenets generally provides a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold with a market value of approximately 4 376 7 the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of 4 6 years and an indicated duration of 3 9 this implies that a 100 basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately 3 9 or 173 with regard to its 162 1 common stock portfolio the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing a 10 decrease in the u s equity market prices could result in a decrease of 16 2 in the market value of the company s common stock portfolio these possible declines in values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the common shareholders equity at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as long as operating cash flow and the ongoing emergence of bond 19 page maturities continued to provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years higher cash flow in 1997 vis a vis 1996 and 1998 was due mainly to higher operating cash flow in old republic s general insurance segment the company s mortgage title and life segments cash flow from operations have been greater in each of the last three years the parent holding company has met its liquidity and capital needs principally through dividends paid by its subsidiaries the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled additionally the terms of guarantees by the company of bank loans to the trustee of the company s employees savings and stock ownership plan restrict the amount of debt the company may incur this covenant is being met old republic s capitalization of 2 450 6 at december 31 1998 consisted of debt and debt equivalents of 145 1 convertible preferred stock of 1 2 and common shareholders equity of 2 304 2 the increase in the common shareholders equity account during the past three years reflects primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares the conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock in 1997 the issuance of additional shares to effect a debt conversion in 1996 and an increase during 1998 and 1997 compared to a decrease during 1996 in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value common shareholders equity increases in 1998 and 1997 were partially offset by the acquisition of 151 1 and 62 1 respectively of common stock in open market transactions at its march 12 1998 meeting the company s board of directors authorized the reacquisition of up to 150 0 of common shares as market conditions would warrant during the twenty four month period from that date as of december 31 1998 a total of 31 9 of this authorization remained unutilized in february 1996 the company called for the redemption of its 10 debentures maturing in 2018 75 0 principal amount and its 5 75 convertible subordinated debentures maturing in 2002 110 0 principal amount in april 1996 the company called for the redemption of its 11 5 debentures maturing in 2015 30 0 principal amount redemption of these debentures was financed with internally available funds while the subordinated debentures were converted by their terms into approximately 9 6 million old republic common shares as a result of these redemptions and conversions the company s debt declined by 215 0 while its common shareholders equity account rose by 108 6 during 1996 the early retirement of the debentures produced a net of tax charge of 4 4 0 03 per diluted common share that has been reflected as an extraordinary item in 1996 in december 1996 the company redeemed all 54 8 of its series h cumulative preferred stock with available funds during the second quarter of 1997 the company issued 115 0 of 7 debentures maturing june 15 2007 proceeds from this offering were used principally to redeem commercial paper debt results of operations revenues consolidated net premiums and fees earned increased by 11 2 8 0 and 9 7 in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively property and liability earned premiums decreased 0 4 in 1998 and increased 4 5 in 1997 and 1 9 in 1996 premium production trends in this segment in the past three years were generally affected by the continuation of a soft pricing environment for most insurance coverages growth in mortgage guaranty premiums for the past three years was enhanced principally by a rise in the amount of renewal business by territorial expansion and by relatively strong mortgage lending activity though 1998 premium revenue growth was hindered by higher loan refinancings title group premiums and fee revenues increased 38 9 in 1998 9 4 in 1997 and 20 3 in 1996 greater housing and mortgage finance activity were the main reasons for the rise in revenues in these years life and disability premium volume increased during the last three years as a result of greater term life and accident insurance production net investment income grew by 0 9 3 9 and 3 4 in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows and by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities the company as previously mentioned used internal funds in 1998 and 1997 for open market purchases of its common stock and in 1996 to redeem certain debt and preferred stock thus reducing the size and earning power of its invested asset base the average annual yield on investments was 5 7 5 9 and 6 0 for the years ended december 31 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively this yield pattern reflects at once the relatively short 20 page maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio a generally declining interest rate climate during the past three years and the commitment of a larger percentage of investable funds to tax exempt fixed maturity securities that typically bear lower pre tax yields while the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize realized investment gains such gains were higher in 1998 than those registered in 1997 and 1996 dispositions of securities have been caused principally by calls prior to maturity by issuers of bonds and notes and by sales of equity securities in 1998 58 3 of total fixed maturity securities dispositions represented contractual maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the year 1997 and 1996 these amounted to 76 9 and 72 5 respectively expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 43 2 in 1998 48 4 in 1997 and 49 9 in 1996 variations in these ratios particularly in 1998 are partially due to the growth in revenue of the mortgage guaranty and title segments which have lower loss ratios than the general insurance segment the general insurance portion of the claim ratio was affected positively by improving claims experience for liability insurance coverages and reduced costs associated with involuntary workers compensation pools this was in part offset by higher loss ratios for physical damage coverages and a moderate amount of catastrophe claims in 1996 and 1998 the loss ratio for mortgage guaranty insurance decreased in 1998 compared to 1997 which itself had decreased slightly compared to that of 1996 the improvement was mostly attributable to the stable economic conditions of the past several years which have led to reduced mortgage defaults particularly in the california market the title insurance loss ratio has been relatively flat in low single digits in each of the past three years due in part to favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 50 2 in 1998 45 2 in 1997 and 46 0 in 1996 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business the property and liability segment s expense ratios increased in 1998 compared to 1997 and 1996 due in part to the previously mentioned premium production trends during the past three years the mortgage guaranty segment particularly in 1998 experienced higher operating expenses due to greater costs associated with contract underwriting operations the title insurance expense ratio has trended lower especially in 1998 due in part to an increase in premium and fees volume without a proportional increase in expenses though higher litigation and related costs in the second half of 1998 increased this segment s expense ratio by approximately 3 5 for the year as a whole consolidated interest and other charges were approximately the same in 1998 and 1997 compared to 1996 due principally to the aforementioned reduction in outstanding debt pre tax and net income consolidated income before taxes increased by 9 4 24 6 and 8 3 in 1998 1997 and 1996 respectively general insurance results declined in 1998 compared to 1997 due to poorer underwriting experience and a slight decrease in investment income 1997 results increased compared to 1996 due to improved underwriting results in old republic s three largest segments and a slight increase in investment income the general insurance segment continued as the largest contributor to consolidated earnings for each of the periods reported upon the mortgage guaranty segment reflected rising earnings in each of the last three years due to increased revenues generating higher income from underwriting operations and a greater invested assets base increases in title insurance earnings during the past three years resulted from growth in premiums and fees a stable loss ratio and a reduction in expense ratios life and disability operations excluding the aforementioned non recurring tax recovery item in 1997 have posted relatively flat earnings in the past three years the effective consolidated income tax rates were 31 2 in 1998 30 3 in 1997 and 31 6 in 1996 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax exempt investment income on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand the lower rate in 1997 was also affected positively by the above noted income tax recoveries for prior years see last paragraph under financial position above for extraordinary charge recorded in 1996 21 page year 2000 issues the company and its subsidiaries have been aware for several years of the issues associated with programming codes in existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches most old republic subsidiaries are operated with reasonable autonomy and accordingly year 2000 issues are independently managed at each of the operating entities simply stated year 2000 issues stem from computer programs that were written in earlier years with only two digits to specify a year as opposed to four digits such programs may therefore be unable to interpret dates beyond 1999 which could cause a system failure or other computer errors that could lead to a disruption of operations year 2000 issues could adversely affect the old republic subsidiaries computer systems and such other systems as communications facilities management service related equipment and systems of customers vendors and other important third party service providers possible adverse consequences include but are not limited to the inability to transact business inability to execute transactions through financial institutions and the occurrence of year 2000 related losses under certain insurance contracts accordingly the company could suffer material adverse financial effects if failure by major subsidiaries significant vendors important third parties or various governmental bodies to properly correct year 2000 issues were to occur the possible financial impact of all such effects cannot currently be estimated since the company and its subsidiaries do not operate in a vacuum and cannot control the situations or actions of the various outside entities with which they deal old republic s subsidiaries are scheduled to complete by march 31 1999 the identification and implementation of changes and the testing of systems affected by year 2000 issues confirmations of year 2000 compliance from principal customers vendors and other important third party relationships are in process of being circulated while this process is not completed the company is not currently aware of any principal customer vendor or other important third party whose year 2000 projects will not be completed in a timely manner the costs of identifying implementing and testing the required changes has not been material to operating results a significant portion of these costs were not incremental as the company and its subsidiaries have mostly utilized existing resources the company s subsidiaries have commenced consideration of contingency plans in the event remediation efforts of year 2000 issues are unsuccessful such plans should be more fully developed in 1999 to the extent deemed applicable and practicable other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating performance liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as old republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years in addition to the factors cited below the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims can have a bearing on period to period comparisons and future operating results any forward looking commentary or inferences contained in this report involve of necessity assumptions uncertainties and risks that may affect the company s future performance with regard to old republic s general insurance segment its results can be affected in particular by the level of market competition which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors the levels of interest and inflation rates as well as periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses and work related injuries mortgage guaranty and title insurance results can be affected by such factors as changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of mortgage loans employment trends and default rates on mortgage loans mortgage guaranty results may also be affected by various risk sharing arrangements with business producers as well as the risk management and pricing policies of government sponsored enterprises life and disability insurance results can be impacted by the levels of employment and consumer spending as well as mortality 22 page and health trends at the holding company level results are affected mostly by the amount of debt outstanding and its cost any forward looking commentaries speak only as of their dates old republic undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise such comments whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise and accordingly they may not be unduly relied upon 23 page",

         " item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four separate segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups non recurring items in the second quarter of 1997 several life insurance subsidiaries recovered income taxes and related accumulated interest due to favorable resolution with the internal revenue service of various outstanding issues pertaining to income tax returns for the years 1979 through 1982 these cash recoveries net of miscellaneous charges increased other income by 12 6 reduced income tax expense by 5 9 and increased after tax consolidated earnings by 14 2 0 10 per diluted common share for the year ended december 31 1997 financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 1999 reflected decreases in assets and common shareholders equity of 1 2 and 4 6 respectively while liabilities increased 5 when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 69 6 and 70 5 of consolidated assets as of december 31 1999 and 1998 respectively consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years 1999 cash flow while positive trended down due mainly to lower contributions from old republic s general insurance segment in 1999 the invested asset base declined principally as a result of the company s stock buy back program the sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary in early 1999 a decrease in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value and the aforementioned reduced contributions from operating cash flow relatively high short term maturity investment positions are generally maintained to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and to enhance flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including operating cash needs and investment strategy accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 1999 and 1998 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities investable funds have not been directed to so called junk bonds or types of securities categorized as derivatives old republic s commitment to equity securities during 1999 decreased slightly vis a vis the related invested balance at year end 1998 at december 31 1999 the company had no bond and note investments in default as to principal and or interest the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations old republic employs traditional investment management tools and techniques to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues and by taking asset liability matching practices into account purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management tenets generally provides a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold with a market value of approximately 4 242 0 the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of 4 5 years and an indicated duration of 3 8 this implies that a 100 basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately 3 8 or 162 with regard to its 157 5 common stock portfolio the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing a 10 decrease in the u s equity market prices could result in a decrease of 15 8 in 19 page the market value of the company s common stock portfolio these possible declines in values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the common shareholders equity at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as long as operating cash flow and the ongoing emergence of bond maturities continued to provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level the parent holding company has met its liquidity and capital needs through dividends paid by its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled additionally the terms of guarantees by the company of bank loans to the trustee of the company s employees savings and stock ownership plan restrict the amount of debt the company may incur this covenant is being met old republic s capitalization of 2 407 5 at december 31 1999 consisted of debt of 208 3 convertible preferred stock of 7 and common shareholders equity of 2 198 4 the changes in the common shareholders equity account for the most recent three calendar years reflect primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares the conversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock in 1997 an increase during 1998 and 1997 compared to a decrease during 1999 in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value and the acquisition of 188 1 151 1 and 62 1 respectively of common stock in open market transactions at its march 11 1999 meeting the company s board of directors authorized the reacquisition of up to 200 0 of common shares as market conditions would warrant during the eighteen month period from that date as of december 31 1999 a total of 43 8 of this authorization remained unutilized results of operations revenues consolidated net premiums and fees earned decreased by 1 6 and increased by 11 2 and 8 0 in 1999 1998 and 1997 respectively property and liability earned premiums decreased 5 4 and 0 4 in 1999 and 1998 respectively and increased 4 5 in 1997 premium production trends in this segment in the past three years were generally affected by the continuation of a soft pricing environment for most insurance coverages growth in mortgage guaranty premiums for the past three years was enhanced principally by a rise in the amount of renewal business by territorial expansion and by relatively strong mortgage lending activity nationwide title group premiums and fee revenues increased 2 8 in 1999 38 9 in 1998 and 9 4 in 1997 greater housing and mortgage finance activity were the main reasons for the rise in revenues in these years though in 1999 a lower volume of mortgage refinancings held down revenue growth life and disability premiums decreased in 1999 due to lower volume of canadian travel accident insurance and increased during 1998 and 1997 as a result of greater term life and accident insurance production net investment income was down by 3 6 and grew by 0 9 and 3 9 in 1999 1998 and 1997 respectively for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows and by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities the company as previously mentioned used internal funds in the three latest calendar years for most open market purchases of its common stock thus reducing the size and earning power of its invested asset base the average annual yield on investments was 5 5 5 7 and 5 9 for the years ended december 31 1999 1998 and 1997 respectively this yield pattern reflects at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio a generally flat to declining interest rate climate during most of the past three years and the greater commitment of investable funds to tax exempt fixed maturity securities that typically bear lower pre tax yields the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize realized investment gains such gains were higher in 1998 than those registered in 1999 and 1997 mostly due to the sale of equity securities dispositions of securities were principally the result of scheduled maturities of bonds and notes and sales of equity securities in 1999 71 0 of total dispositions represented contractual maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the years 1998 and 1997 these amounted to 58 3 and 76 9 respectively 20 page expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 46 8 in 1999 43 2 in 1998 and 48 4 in 1997 the general insurance portion of the claim ratio was much more adverse in 1999 and was relatively stable in 1998 and 1997 greater severity for the most recent loss occurrences was mainly responsible for the higher general insurance claim ratio in 1999 while the rise in this ratio is largely attributable to commercial automobile truck insurance coverages smaller parts of old republic s risk transfer business also experienced increases the loss ratio for mortgage guaranty insurance decreased in each of the last three years the improvement was mostly attributable to the stable economic conditions of the past several years which have led to reduced mortgage defaults particularly in the california market the title insurance loss ratio has been relatively flat in low single digits in each of the past three years due in part to more favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 52 6 in 1999 50 2 in 1998 and 45 2 in 1997 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages underwritten and attendant costs of producing business the property and liability segment s expense ratio increased in 1999 compared to 1998 and 1997 due in part to the previously noted premium production trends during the past three years the mortgage guaranty segment experienced higher operating expenses due to costs associated with contract underwriting operations and enhancement of information systems in particular the title insurance expense ratio was approximately the same in 1999 and 1997 due in part to premium and fees growth being less than that of expenses consumer and regulatory litigation and disputes in old republic s california title insurance subsidiary added litigation costs of 16 2 and 19 5 in 1999 and 1998 respectively consolidated interest and other corporate charges were approximately the same in each of the last three years pre tax and net income consolidated income before taxes decreased by 32 1 in 1999 and increased by 9 4 in 1998 and 24 6 in 1997 general insurance results declined significantly in 1999 compared to 1998 and 1997 due to poorer underwriting experience and lower investment income the mortgage guaranty segment reflected rising earnings in each of the last three years due to increased revenues generating higher income from underwriting operations and from a greater invested assets base title insurance earnings during the past three years were higher in 1998 compared to 1999 and 1997 which resulted from the previously noted claim and expense trends life and disability operations excluding the aforementioned non recurring tax recovery item in 1997 registered relatively flat earnings in 1998 and 1997 earnings in 1999 benefited from the revision of certain actuarial factors used in calculating various life and health reserves and deferred acquisition costs the net benefit the majority of which applied to 1999 premium revenues amounted to approximately 4 8 this was partially offset by underwriting losses in old republic s canadian travel accident coverages the effective consolidated income tax rates were 29 3 in 1999 31 2 in 1998 and 30 3 in 1997 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax sheltered investment income principally tax exempt interest on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand the lower rate in 1999 resulted from reduced income from underwriting and related services the rate in 1997 was also affected positively by the above noted income tax recoveries for prior years year 2000 issues year 2000 issues relate primarily to computer programs which were written with only a two digit designation for many years such programs are often unable to interpret dates beyond 1999 and as a result may fail or lead to computer errors which could create a disruption in operations prior to december 31 1999 the company and its subsidiaries completed an implementation of changes and tests of those computer systems and programs that had been identified as being affected by year 2000 issues they also received confirmations of year 2000 compliance from certain principal customers vendors and other third parties with whom they have significant business relationships the company and its subsidiaries had also developed contingency plans for operations in the event year 2000 issues were to arise in spite of the changes and tests effected 21 page the costs of identifying implementing and testing the required changes were not material to the company s consolidated operating results a significant portion of these costs were not incremental as the company and its subsidiaries generally used existing resources early in the current year no issues are known to have developed nor affect adversely the company or any of its subsidiaries although the company considers it increasingly unlikely it is possible that year 2000 issues may have arisen but are not yet known the aforementioned contingency plans are deemed appropriate to address such subsequent events no significant additional costs are being anticipated with respect to year 2000 issues other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating performance liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as old republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years in addition to the factors cited below the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims can have a bearing on period to period comparisons and future operating results any forward looking commentary or inferences contained in this report involve of necessity assumptions uncertainties and risks that may affect the company s future performance with regard to old republic s general insurance segment its results can be affected in particular by the level of market competition which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors the levels of interest and inflation rates as well as periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses and work related injuries mortgage guaranty and title insurance results can be affected by such factors as changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of mortgage loans employment trends and default rates on mortgage loans mortgage guaranty results may also be affected by various risk sharing arrangements with business producers as well as the risk management and pricing policies of government sponsored enterprises life and disability insurance results can be impacted by the levels of employment and consumer spending as well as mortality and health trends at the holding company level operating earnings or losses are generally affected by the amount of debt outstanding and its cost as well as interest income on temporary short term investments any forward looking commentaries speak only as of their dates old republic undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise such comments whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise and accordingly they may not be unduly relied upon 22 page",

         " item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation the company conducts its business through four separate segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 2000 reflected increases in assets liabilities and common shareholders equity of 4 9 2 2 and 10 9 respectively when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 70 6 and 69 6 of consolidated assets as of december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years 2000 cash flow returned to a level slightly above the amount reported for 1998 1999 cash flow was down compared to 2000 and 1998 due mainly to lower contributions from old republic s general insurance segment in 2000 the invested asset base increased 6 3 principally as a result of greater operating cash flow and an increase in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value this was offset slightly by cash outflow to finance the company s stock buy back program relatively high short term maturity investment positions are generally maintained to provide necessary liquidity for specific operating needs and to enhance flexibility in investment strategy changes in short term investments reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including expected operating cash flows and investment strategy accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 2000 and 1999 the corporation committed most investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities investable funds have not been directed to so called junk bonds or types of securities categorized as derivatives old republic s commitment to equity securities during 2000 increased vis a vis the related invested balance at year end 1999 due to securities acquired and unrealized gains during the period at december 31 2000 the carrying value of bond and note investments in default as to principal and or interest was immaterial in relation to consolidated assets or shareholders equity the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets base the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues and by taking asset liability matching practices into account purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management tenets is expected to produce a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold with a market value of approximately 4 338 5 the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of 4 4 years and an indicated duration of 3 8 this implies that a 100 basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately 3 8 or 162 with regard to its 292 9 common stock portfolio the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing a 10 decrease in the u s equity market prices could result in a decrease of 29 2 in the market value of the company s common stock portfolio these possible declines in values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the level of the common shareholders equity account at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as a likely combination of positive operating cash flow and the scheduled emergence of bond maturities should provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level the parent holding company generally meets its liquidity and capital needs through dividends paid by its subsidiaries and the issuance of short term debt the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company however is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities 19 page of the states in which they are domiciled old republic s capitalization of 2 677 4 at december 31 2000 consisted of long and short term debt of 238 0 a minor amount of convertible preferred stock and common shareholders equity of 2 438 7 the changes in the common shareholders equity account for the most recent three calendar years reflect primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares an increase during 2000 and 1998 compared to a decrease during 1999 in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value and the acquisition of 66 4 188 1 and 151 1 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively of the company s common shares in open market transactions in march 2000 the company canceled 36 4 million common shares previously reported as treasury stock restoring them to unissued status this had no effect on total shareholders equity or the financial condition of the company at its march 23 2000 meeting the company s board of directors authorized the reacquisition of up to 200 0 of common shares as market conditions would warrant during the two year period from that date as of december 31 2000 a total of 177 3 of this authorization remained unutilized results of operations revenues consolidated net premiums and fees earned decreased by 2 5 and 1 6 in 2000 and 1999 respectively and increased by 11 2 in 1998 property and liability earned premiums increased 0 5 in 2000 and decreased 5 4 and 0 4 in 1999 and 1998 respectively premium production trends in this segment in the past three years were generally affected by a soft pricing environment that until late 1999 made it difficult for the company to obtain rate increases in a market place that s remained quite competitive during the year 2000 old republic continued to shed some of the business for which it was unable to obtain necessary rate relief growth in mortgage guaranty premiums for the past three years was enhanced principally by relatively strong mortgage lending activity nationwide and by greater persistency of business in force in 1999 and 2000 title group premiums and fee revenues decreased 13 9 in 2000 and increased 2 8 in 1999 and 38 9 in 1998 greater housing and mortgage finance activity were the main reasons for the rise in revenues in 1999 and 1998 the decrease in 2000 resulted mostly from a substantial decline in refinancings life and disability premiums in 2000 were approximately the same as in 1999 they decreased in 1999 due to reduced volume of canadian travel accident insurance and increased during 1998 as a result of greater term life and accident insurance production net investment income grew by 4 1 and 0 9 in 2000 and 1998 respectively and was down 3 6 in 1999 for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities and by changes in market yields as previously noted the company used mostly internal funds in the three latest calendar years for open market purchases of its common stock thus reducing the size and earning power of its invested assets base the average annual yield on investments was 5 6 5 5 and 5 7 for the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively this yield pattern reflects at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio an uptrend in yields in 2000 and generally flat to declining yields during most of 1999 and 1998 the company s investment policies are not designed to maximize realized investment gains such gains were higher in 1998 than those registered in 2000 and 1999 mostly due to the discretionary sale of equity securities as market and other considerations warranted dispositions of securities were principally the result of scheduled maturities of bonds and notes and sales of equity securities in 2000 79 9 of total dispositions represented contractual maturities and early calls of existing holdings for the years 1999 and 1998 these amounted to 71 0 and 58 3 respectively expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 43 8 in 2000 46 8 in 1999 and 43 2 in 1998 the general insurance portion of the claims ratio improved in 2000 compared to 1999 s the ratio for the latter was significantly higher when compared to that for 1998 greater severity for the most recent loss occurrences was mainly responsible for the higher general insurance claim ratio in the last two calendar years the higher ratios were largely attributable to commercial automobile truck liability insurance coverages though smaller parts of old republic s risk transfer business also experienced increases in 1999 in particular when compared to 2000 and 1998 the loss ratio for mortgage guaranty insurance declined in each of the last three years the improvement was mostly attributable to the strong employment and good general economic conditions which have led to lower loan default rates and much higher cure rates for loans exhibiting payment difficulties the title insurance loss ratio has been in the low single digits in each of the past three years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 49 6 in 2000 52 6 in 1999 and 50 2 in 1998 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages underwritten and attendant costs of producing business the property and liability segment s 20 page expense ratio remained approximately the same averaging 28 3 during the latest three year period the mortgage guaranty segment s expense ratio decreased in 2000 compared to 1999 and 1998 due to lower costs associated with an enhancement of information systems substantially completed in 1999 and a reduction in costs associated with contract underwriting services the title insurance expense ratio was higher in 2000 and 1999 due in part to a decline or reduced growth in premium and fees relative to production and operating costs consumer and regulatory litigation and disputes in old republic s california title insurance subsidiary were responsible for expenses of 4 1 16 2 and 19 5 charged to 2000 1999 and 1998 operations respectively consolidated interest and other corporate charges rose in 2000 due primarily to greater interest costs from a higher debt level pre tax and net income consolidated income before taxes increased by 34 5 in 2000 declined by 32 1 in 1999 and rose by 9 4 in 1998 general insurance results improved significantly in 2000 compared to 1999 due to better underwriting experience which nonetheless was still lower than that achieved in 1998 the mortgage guaranty segment reflected rising earnings in each of the last three years due to increased premium revenues that generated higher income from underwriting operations and higher investment income from a greater invested assets base title insurance earnings during the past three years were higher in 1998 compared to 2000 and 1999 this reflected the previously noted revenue and expense trends life and disability operations registered slightly increased earnings in 2000 whereas 1999 earnings benefited from the revision of certain actuarial factors used in calculating various life and health reserves and deferred acquisition costs the net benefit of these revisions the majority of which applied to 1999 premium revenues amounted to approximately 4 8 this was partially offset by underwriting losses in old republic s canadian travel accident coverages the effective consolidated income tax rates were 30 7 in 2000 29 3 in 1999 and 31 2 in 1998 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from tax sheltered investment income principally tax exempt interest on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand the lower rate in 1999 resulted from reduced income from underwriting and related services other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating performance liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as old republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years in addition to the factors cited below the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims can have a bearing on period to period comparisons and future operating results any forward looking commentary or inferences contained in this report involve of necessity assumptions uncertainties and risks that may affect the company s future performance with regard to old republic s general insurance segment its results can be affected in particular by the level of market competition which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors the levels of interest and inflation rates as well as periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses work related injuries and unanticipated external events mortgage guaranty and title insurance results can be affected by such factors as changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of mortgage loans employment trends and default rates on mortgage loans mortgage guaranty results may also be affected by various risk sharing arrangements with business producers as well as the risk management and pricing policies of government sponsored enterprises life and disability insurance results can be impacted by the levels of employment and consumer spending as well as mortality and health trends at the holding company level operating earnings or losses are generally affected by the amount of debt outstanding and its cost as well as interest income on temporary holdings of short term investments any forward looking commentaries speak only as of their dates old republic undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise such comments whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise and accordingly they may not be unduly relied upon 21 page ",

         "item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation which are presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company conducts its business through four separate segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups changes in accounting policies during 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued two pronouncements affecting accounting for business combinations occurring after june 30 2001 and the related treatment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded pursuant to such or earlier combinations in general terms the first pronouncement requires that business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be treated as purchases for financial accounting purposes that the alternative pooling of interests method of accounting be eliminated and that identifiable assets meeting certain criteria for intangibles be set apart from any purchased goodwill this pronouncement had no impact on the company in 2001 under the second pronouncement which takes effect for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 all goodwill resulting from business combinations will no longer be amortized against operations but must be tested periodically for possible impairment of its continued value within six months of application of this second pronouncement a transitional goodwill impairment test needs to be performed and any resulting charge is to be reported as a change in accounting principle old republic will adhere to these pronouncements in 2002 and will determine the impact if any of the transitional or subsequent annual impairment tests on its financial position and results of operations as of december 31 2001 the company s consolidated unamortized goodwill asset balance was 84 8 and the average annual charge from goodwill amortization to operating results for the three most recent calendar years was approximately 4 0 or 3 cents per average diluted share financial position old republic s financial position at december 31 2001 reflected increases in assets liabilities and common shareholders equity of 8 8 6 1 and 14 1 respectively when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 70 5 and 70 6 of consolidated assets as of december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively consolidated operations produced positive cash flows for the latest three years the increases in operating cash flow for 2001 and 2000 were mostly due to greater contributions by the company s three largest operating segments in 2001 the invested asset base increased 8 6 to 5 586 7 principally as a result of greater operating cash flow in each of its business segments and an increase in the value of fixed maturity and equity securities carried at market value short term investment positions reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including current operating needs expected operating cash flows and investment strategy accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 2001 and 2000 the corporation committed most investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities and equity securities old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities investable funds have not been directed to so called junk bonds or types of securities categorized as derivatives old republic s commitment to equity securities during 2001 increased in relation to the related invested balance at year end 2000 due to portfolio additions and net unrealized gains at december 31 2001 the company had no fixed maturity investments in default as to principal and or interest the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets base the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues and by taking asset liability matching practices into account purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management tenets is expected to produce a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold with a market value of approximately 4 783 9 the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of 4 3 years and an indicated duration of 3 8 this implies that a 100 basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately 3 7 or 178 1 with regard to its 389 8 common stock portfolio 18 page the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing a 10 decrease in the u s equity market prices could result in a decrease of 38 9 in the market value of the company s common stock portfolio these possible declines in values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the level of the common shareholders equity account at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as a likely combination of positive operating cash flow and the scheduled emergence of bond maturities should provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level among other major assets substantially all of the company s accounts and notes receivable are not past due and reinsurance receivable balances on paid or estimated unpaid losses are deemed to be fairly stated and recoverable from responsible reinsurers regulatory and related gaap reclassifications that took effect at the beginning of 2001 pertained mostly to the recording of estimated premiums due subsequent to each balance sheet date and had the approximate effect of increasing accounts receivable by 110 9 deferred acquisition costs by 15 7 and unearned premiums by 110 9 as of december 31 2001 these changes had no effect on the company s net income for 2001 the parent holding company generally meets its liquidity and capital needs through dividends paid by its subsidiaries and the issuance of short term debt the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company however is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled during 2001 the company used a part of available cash flow to redeem a portion of its commercial paper outstanding thereby reducing consolidated debt by approximately 79 0 old republic s capitalization of 2 943 1 at december 31 2001 consisted of long and short term debt of 159 0 a minor amount of convertible preferred stock and common shareholders equity of 2 783 7 changes in the common shareholders equity account for the three most recent years reflect primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares an increase during 2001 and 2000 compared to a decrease during 1999 in the value of bonds and stocks carried at market value and the acquisition of 66 4 and 188 1 in 2000 and 1999 respectively of the company s common shares in open market transactions in march 2000 the company canceled 36 4 million common shares previously reported as treasury stock restoring them to unissued status this had no effect on total shareholders equity or the financial condition of the company at its march 23 2000 meeting the company s board of directors authorized the reacquisition of up to 200 0 of common shares as market conditions would warrant during the two year period from that date as of december 31 2001 a total of 177 3 of this authorization remained unutilized and is expected to be extended for an additional period of time in 2002 results of operations revenues consolidated net premiums and fees earned increased by 16 9 in 2001 and decreased by 2 5 and 1 6 in 2000 and 1999 respectively property and liability earned premiums increased 16 6 and 0 5 in 2001 and 2000 respectively and decreased 5 4 in 1999 positive premium production trends in this segment reflect pricing and risk selection improvements implemented for the past two years or so during 2001 in particular old republic experienced greater success in retaining existing accounts and obtaining new accounts at generally rising prices growth in mortgage guaranty premiums for the past three years was enhanced principally by relatively strong mortgage lending activity nationwide and in 2001 in particular by much greater refinancing activity due to a downtrend in mortgage rates title group premium and fee revenues increased by 26 6 and 2 8 in 2001 and 1999 respectively but declined by 13 9 in 2000 these results largely reflect varying levels of housing and mortgage lending activity during these years with 2001 s much greater refinancing activity accounting for a major portion of the increase the decline in 2000 title premiums and fees resulted mostly from a substantial drop in mortgage refinancing activity life and disability premiums decreased in 2001 and were approximately the same in 2000 and 1999 net investment income grew by 0 3 and 4 1 in 2001 and 2000 respectively and was down 3 6 in 1999 for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities and by changes in market yields between 1999 and mid year 2000 the company used mostly internally generated funds for the aforementioned open market purchases of approximately 16 6 million shares of its common stock thus reducing the size and earning power of its invested assets base the average annual yield on investments was 5 2 5 6 and 5 5 for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively these yields reflect at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio an uptrend in yields in 2000 generally flat to declining yields during most of 2001 and 1999 and a moderately greater commitment to equity securities which typically provide lower current yields the company s investment policies are not designed to maximize investment gains net investment gains were moderately lower in 2001 than those registered in 2000 and basically level with those posted in 1999 such net gains were mostly due to discretionary and market driven dispositions or valuations of equity and fixed maturity security holdings in 2001 88 7 of total dispositions of securities were represented by contractual maturities and early calls of fixed maturity security holdings for the years 2000 and 1999 these amounted to 79 9 and 71 0 respectively 19 page expenses consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs as a percentage of net premiums and fees earned were approximately 42 4 in 2001 43 8 in 2000 and 46 8 in 1999 the general insurance portion of the claims ratio improved in 2001 compared to 2000 which also reflected an improvement over 1999 in addition to the effect of a soft pricing environment for most property and liability coverages during the 1990 s greater severity for the most recent loss occurrences was mainly responsible for the higher general insurance claim ratio in 2000 and 1999 the higher ratios were largely driven by commercial automobile truck liability insurance coverages though smaller portions of old republic s property and liability business also experienced increases in 1999 when compared to 2001 and 2000 the loss ratio for mortgage guaranty insurance declined in 2000 and 1999 the improvement was mostly attributable to the strong employment and good general economic conditions which led to reasonably stable loan default rates and higher cure rates for loans exhibiting payment difficulties a small increase in 2001 was largely the result of moderately higher loan default rates the title insurance loss ratio has been in the low single digits in each of the past three years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 in particular consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs for each of the company s business segments are affected by the adequacy of reserves established for current and prior years claim occurrences such reserves are recorded on a case by case basis and by means of a large number of formulas and calculations to cover known as well as incurred but not as yet reported claims at each balance sheet date in the aggregate the company s record in establishing such reserves has not indicated deficiencies in the past decade however the reserves posted by insurers such as the company are necessarily based on a wide variety of estimates can be affected by lagging claim emergence or reporting delays and their ultimate disposition is subject to a multitude of economic political judicial and societal factors that cannot be anticipated or quantified accurately accordingly there can be no guaranty that such reserves will always be on the mark and any redundancies or deficiencies would be recorded in the periods during which they emerge and are quantified the company s mix of coverages industries served and long standing objective of assuring wide dispersion of risks in selected geographical areas have likely minimized claim exposures related to the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on america the income statement for the year ended december 31 2001 nonetheless includes charges aggregating approximately 4 0 to cover the possibility of isolated property workers compensation trip delay and life insurance claims the resulting aggregate post tax charge of 2 6 reduced consolidated net income 2 cents per share the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was approximately 48 8 in 2001 49 6 in 2000 and 52 6 in 1999 variations in these ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages underwritten and attendant costs of producing business for each of the company s segments the property and liability segment s expense ratio remained approximately the same averaging 27 9 during the latest three year period the mortgage guaranty segment s expense ratio decreased to 27 5 in 2001 compared to 29 6 in 2000 and 33 5 in 1999 due to greater efficiencies gained in the distribution and servicing of its products the title insurance expense ratio was higher in 2000 and 1999 due in part to the aforementioned decline or reduced growth in premium and fee volume relative to operating costs a much increased title sales volume in 2001 led to a lower expense ratio consumer and regulatory litigation affecting old republic s california title insurance subsidiary was responsible for expenses of 6 8 4 1 and 16 2 charged to 2001 2000 and 1999 operations respectively consolidated interest and other corporate charges decreased in 2001 due primarily to reduced interest costs on a gradually lower debt level pre tax and net income consolidated income before taxes increased by 18 2 and 34 5 in 2001 and 2000 respectively and declined by 32 1 in 1999 general insurance results improved significantly in 2001 and 2000 compared to 1999 due to better underwriting experience the mortgage guaranty segment reflected rising earnings in each of the last three years due to increased premium revenues that generated higher income from underwriting operations and higher investment income from a greater invested asset base title insurance earnings were higher in 2001 compared to 2000 and 1999 this reflected the previously noted revenue and expense trends life and disability operations registered decreased earnings in 2001 and slightly increased earnings in 2000 whereas 1999 earnings benefited from the revision of certain actuarial factors used in calculating various life and health reserves and deferred acquisition costs the net benefit of these revisions the majority of which applied to 1999 premium revenues amounted to approximately 4 8 this was partially offset by underwriting losses in old republic s canadian travel accident coverages the effective consolidated income tax rates were 31 7 in 2001 30 7 in 2000 and 29 3 in 1999 the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pre tax operating income derived from partially tax sheltered investment income principally tax exempt interest on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the other hand 20 page other information reference is here made to financial information relating to segments of business appearing elsewhere herein historical data pertaining to the operating performance liquidity and other financial matters applicable to an insurance enterprise such as old republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years in addition to the factors cited below the long term nature of the insurance business seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims changes in yields obtained on invested assets changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed claims can have a bearing on period to period comparisons and future operating results any forward looking commentary or inferences contained in this report involve of necessity assumptions uncertainties and risks that may affect the company s future performance with regard to old republic s general insurance segment its results can be affected in particular by the level of market competition which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors the levels of interest and inflation rates as well as periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses work related injuries and unanticipated external events mortgage guaranty and title insurance results can be affected by such factors as changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of mortgage loans employment trends and default rates on mortgage loans mortgage guaranty results may also be affected by various risk sharing arrangements with business producers as well as the risk management and pricing policies of government sponsored enterprises life and disability insurance results can be impacted by the levels of employment and consumer spending as well as mortality and health trends at the holding company level operating earnings or losses are generally affected by the amount of debt outstanding and its cost as well as interest income on temporary holdings of short term investments any forward looking commentaries speak only as of their dates old republic undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise such comments whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise and accordingly they may not be unduly relied upon 21 page",

         "item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation which are presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company conducts its business through four separate segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes thereto included elsewhere in this document changes in accounting policies during 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued two pronouncements affecting accounting for business combinations occurring after june 30 2001 and the related treatment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded pursuant to such or earlier combinations in general terms the first pronouncement requires that business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be treated as purchases for financial accounting purposes that the alternative pooling of interests method of accounting be eliminated and that identifiable assets meeting certain criteria for intangibles be set apart from any purchased goodwill this pronouncement had no impact on the company in 2001 under the second pronouncement which took effect for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 all goodwill resulting from business combinations will no longer be amortized against operations but must be tested periodically for possible impairment of its carried value within six months of application of this second pronouncement a transitional goodwill impairment test needs to be performed and any resulting charge is to be reported as a change in accounting principle as of december 31 2001 the company s consolidated unamortized goodwill asset balance was 84 8 and the average annual charge from goodwill amortization to operating results for the three calendar years ended 2001 was approximately 4 0 or 3 cents per average diluted share the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test required by fas 142 in the first quarter of 2002 and determined that there was no indication of goodwill or intangible asset impairment financial position the company s financial position at december 31 2002 reflected increases in assets liabilities and common shareholders equity of 10 0 8 2 and 13 4 respectively when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 70 8 and 70 5 of consolidated assets as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively consolidated results produced positive operating cash flows for the latest three years the increases in operating cash flow for these years were mostly due to greater contributions by the company s three largest operating segments in 2002 the invested asset base increased 10 4 to 6 168 2 principally as a result of such greater operating cash flow relatively high short term investment positions were maintained as of december 31 2002 and 2001 such investment positions reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including current operating needs expected operating cash flows and investment strategy considerations accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels during 2002 and 2001 the corporation committed most investable funds in short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities and equity securities old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities investable funds have not been directed to so called junk bonds or types of securities categorized as derivatives old republic s commitment to equity securities during 2002 increased in relation to the related invested balance at year end 2001 due to portfolio additions offset by net unrealized losses at december 31 2002 the carrying value of fixed maturity investments in default as to principal and or interest was immaterial in relation to consolidated assets or shareholders equity the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets base the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues and by taking asset liability matching practices into account purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management tenets is expected to produce a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net unrealized gains or losses as to securities classified as available for sale with a market value of approximately 5 344 2 the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of 3 9 17 page years and an indicated duration of 3 5 with regard to its 513 5 equity portfolio the company does not own nor engage in any type of option writing possible declines in values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios could affect negatively the level of the common shareholders equity account at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses in such circumstances the likely combination of positive operating cash flows and the scheduled emergence of maturities from the company s short duration bond portfolio should provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level the company reviews the status and market value changes of its securities portfolio on at least a quarterly basis during the year and any provisions for other than temporary impairments in the portfolio s value are evaluated and established at each quarterly balance sheet date in management s opinion the company s high quality and diversified portfolio which consists largely of publicly traded securities has been a basic reason for the absence of major impairment provisions in the periods reported upon the combination of gains and losses on sales of securities and such provisions or write downs of securities are reflected as realized gains and losses in the income statement in reviewing investments for other than temporary impairment the company in addition to a security s market price history considers the issuer s operating results financial condition and liquidity its ability to access capital markets credit rating trends most current audit opinion industry and securities markets conditions and analyst expectations in their totality to reach its conclusions the company recognized other than temporary impairments of investments in the amounts of 19 0 and 6 7 for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively no such impairments were recognized during the year ended december 31 2000 unrealized gains or losses on securities classified as available for sale and carried at fair value are reflected directly in shareholders equity among other major assets substantially all of the company s receivables are not past due and reinsurance recoverable balances on paid or estimated unpaid losses are deemed to be fairly stated and recoverable from solvent reinsurers deferred policy acquisition costs are estimated by taking into account the variable costs of producing specific types of insurance policies and evaluating their recoverability on the basis of recent trends in claims costs the company s deferred acquisition cost balances have not fluctuated materially from period to period and do not represent significant percentages of assets shareholders equity or premium reserves the parent holding company meets its liquidity and capital needs principally through dividends paid by its subsidiaries the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled in contemplation of such restrictions and approvals the company can receive up to 227 4 in dividends from its subsidiaries in 2003 the liquidity achievable through such permitted dividend payments is more than adequate to cover the parent holding company s cash outflow represented mostly by interest on outstanding debt and quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders in addition old republic can access the commercial paper market for up to 150 0 to meet unanticipated liquidity needs during 2002 the company used a part of available cash flow to redeem a portion of its commercial paper outstanding thereby reducing consolidated debt by approximately 15 0 old republic s capitalization of 3 297 4 at december 31 2002 consisted of debt of 141 5 a minor amount of convertible preferred stock and common shareholders equity of 3 155 8 changes in the common shareholders equity account for the three most recent years reflect primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares an increase in the value of investments carried at fair values and the repurchase of 66 4 in 2000 of the company s common shares in open market transactions in march 2000 the company canceled 36 4 million common shares previously reported as treasury stock restoring them to unissued status this had no effect on total shareholders equity or the financial condition of the company at its march 2002 meeting the company s board of directors authorized the reacquisition of up to 200 0 of common shares as market conditions warrant during the two year period from that date no stock had as yet been acquired through december 31 2002 pursuant to this authorization results of operations revenues pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the insurance industry benefits claims and expenses are associated with the related revenues by means of the provision for policy benefits the deferral and subsequent amortization of acquisition costs and the recognition of incurred benefits claims and operating expenses general insurance property and liability and level term credit life insurance premiums are reflected in income on a pro rata basis earned but unbilled premiums are generally taken into income on the billing date and adjustments for retrospective premiums commissions and similar charges are accrued on the basis of periodic evaluations of current underwriting experience and contractual obligations first year and renewal mortgage guaranty premiums are recognized as income on a straight line basis except that a portion of first year premiums received for certain high risk policies is deferred and reported as earned over the estimated policy life including renewal periods single premiums for mortgage guaranty policies covering more than one year are earned on an accelerated basis over the policy term title insurance premiums are recognized as income upon the substantial completion of the policy issuance process title abstract escrow service and other fees are taken into income at the time of closing of the related escrow ordinary life premiums are 18 page recognized as revenue when due decreasing term credit life and credit disability accident health insurance premiums are generally earned on a sum of the years digits or similar method the composition of old republic s earned premiums and fees for the periods reported upon was as follows years ended december 31 2002 2001 2000 general insurance group 1 184 1 1 000 2 857 8 mortgage guaranty group 376 2 353 1 331 4 title insurance group 813 4 625 3 494 0 life insurance group 50 1 50 6 53 4 consolidated 2 423 9 2 029 5 1 736 8 consolidated net premiums and fees earned increased by 19 4 in 2002 and 16 9 in 2001 and decreased by 2 5 in 2000 earned premiums in the general insurance group increased 18 4 16 6 and 0 5 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively as a result of positive pricing and risk selection changes the company has effected during the past three years as well as additional business produced in an environment marked by a more restrictive marketing stance on the part of many competitors during 2002 and 2001 in particular old republic experienced greater success in retaining existing accounts and obtaining new accounts at generally rising prices mortgage guaranty premium income trends reflect greater sales opportunities arising from strong housing and mortgage lending markets offset in part by a high level of mortgage refinancing activity and a greater amount of reinsurance cessions high loan refinancing activity tends to reduce mortgage guaranty insurers policies in force and thus renewal premium production since previously insured mortgages may no longer require coverage or may become insured by competitors title group premium and fee revenues increased by 30 1 and 26 6 in 2002 and 2001 respectively but declined by 13 9 in 2000 these results reflect a continuation of favorable market conditions for the sale of new and used homes and most importantly strong mortgage refinancing activity driven by a fairy consistent drop in mortgage rates during 2001 and 2002 the decline in 2000 title premiums and fees resulted mostly from a substantial drop in mortgage refinancing activity life and disability premiums volume has continued to reflect the flattish trends of the past several years as growth for the company s limited product offerings has been inhibited by significant price competition among life and health insurers consolidated net investment income was down 0 8 in 2002 and grew by 0 3 and 4 1 in 2001 and 2000 respectively for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by positive consolidated operating cash flows by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities and by changes in market yields the average annual yield on investments was 5 1 5 6 and 5 9 for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively yield trends reflect at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio a continuation of a progressively lower yield environment during 2002 and 2001 a slight uptrend in yields in 2000 and a moderate increase in equity investments which typically produce lower current yields the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize realized investment gains net realized gains were lower in 2002 than those registered in 2001 and 2000 and result from the dispositions and aforementioned write downs of fixed maturity and equity securities dispositions of fixed maturity securities arise mostly from scheduled maturities and early calls for 2002 2001 and 2000 74 9 88 7 and 79 9 respectively of all such dispositions resulted from these factors expenses the percentage of net benefits claims and related settlement expenses measured against premiums and related fee revenues of the company s operating segments were as follows years ended december 31 2002 2001 2000 general insurance group 72 6 75 3 77 9 mortgage guaranty group 14 1 16 1 15 0 title insurance group 5 0 4 0 3 6 life insurance group 58 0 59 7 55 3 consolidated 40 2 42 4 43 9 the general insurance portion of the claims ratio improved in 2002 compared to 2001 which also reflected an improvement over 2000 the downtrend in this major cost factor reflects largely the aforementioned pricing and risk selection improvements effected in the past thirty six months or so in addition to the effect of a soft pricing environment for most property and liability coverages during the 1990 s greater severity for recent loss occurrences was mainly responsible for the higher general insurance claim ratio in 2000 the lower 2002 mortgage guaranty claims ratio results from a decline in claim provisions driven principally by a drop in expected claim severity while the improvement in the 2000 ratio was mostly attributable to the strong employment and good general economic conditions which led to reasonably stable loan default rates and higher cure rates for loans exhibiting payment difficulties a small increase in 2001 19 page was largely the result of a moderately higher loan default rate factor the title insurance loss ratio has been in the low single digits in each of the past three years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 in particular the uptrend in the 2002 title insurance loss ratio stems from a rise in the net provision for ultimate claim costs from the historically low levels achieved in years 2001 and 2000 old republic s life and health benefit and claims ratio though reasonably stable in the periods reported upon can vary widely from period to period due to the relatively small size of this segment s book of business and the material impact that even a slight change in frequency or severity of death and health claims can have the consolidated benefit and claim ratio reflects the changing effect of period to period contributions of each segment to consolidated results and this ratio s variances within each segment consolidated benefit claim and related settlement costs for each of the company s business segments are affected by the adequacy of reserves established for current and prior years claim occurrences such reserves are recorded on a case by case basis and by means of a large number of formulas and calculations to cover known as well as incurred but not as yet reported claims at each balance sheet date in the aggregate the company s record in establishing such reserves has not indicated deficiencies for many years however the reserves posted by insurers such as the company are necessarily based on a wide variety of estimates made by a large number of employees and third parties such as independent claim adjusters and attorneys can be affected by lagging claim emergence or reporting delays and their ultimate disposition is subject to a multitude of economic political judicial and societal factors that cannot be anticipated or quantified accurately accordingly there can be no guaranty that such reserves will always be on the mark the company s mix of coverages industries served and long standing objective of assuring wide dispersion of risks in selected geographical areas minimized claim exposures related to the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on america the income statement for the year ended december 31 2001 nonetheless included charges aggregating approximately 4 0 to cover isolated property workers compensation trip delay and life insurance claims the resulting aggregate post tax charge of 2 6 reduced consolidated net income 2 cents per share the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was 47 9 in 2002 46 5 in 2001 and 47 7 in 2000 variations in these consolidated ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business in the company s four business segments the following table sets forth the expense ratios recorded by each business segment for the periods shown years ended december 31 2002 2001 2000 general insurance group 25 8 26 7 28 1 mortgage guaranty group 32 3 27 5 29 6 title insurance group 85 6 87 2 92 4 life insurance group 42 5 45 4 50 6 consolidated 47 9 46 5 47 7 expense ratios for the company as a whole have remained basically stable for the periods reported upon the slight downtrend in the general insurance group s expense ratio reflects the benefits of firm general expense management in the face of a greater revenue base the mortgage guaranty segment s expense ratio decreased in 2001 and 2000 due to greater efficiencies gained in the distribution and servicing of its products the increase in this ratio for 2002 was due to the posting of special operating charges aggregating 20 5 these charges stemmed from the cessation of the development and marketing of a loan portfolio evaluation service aimed at existing and potential mortgage guaranty insurance customers and a reassessment of certain class action litigation exposures the title insurance expense ratio was higher in 2000 due in part to the decline or reduced growth in premium and fee volume relative to operating costs a much increased title sales volume in 2001 and 2002 led to a lower expense ratio for those years consumer and regulatory litigation affecting old republic s california title insurance subsidiary was responsible for expenses of 3 4 6 8 and 4 1 charged to 2002 2001 and 2000 operations respectively consolidated interest and other corporate charges decreased in 2002 due primarily to reduced interest costs on a declining debt level pretax and net income consolidated income before taxes increased by 11 3 18 2 and 34 5 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the following table reflects each segment s contribution to pretax operating results which excludes realized investments gains or losses years ended december 31 2002 2001 2000 general insurance group 182 1 141 4 116 9 mortgage guaranty group 267 7 261 9 240 1 title insurance group 97 8 74 6 40 3 life insurance group 6 4 4 9 5 3 consolidated 546 9 474 2 392 7 20 page general insurance results improved meaningfully in 2002 2001 and 2000 by virtue of the better underwriting experience produced by the above noted factors that affected loss and expense ratios further growth of mortgage guaranty income from underwriting and investments and accelerated growth in premiums and fees from greater refinancing activity which benefited the title insurance group in particular also led to greater contributions to consolidated pretax operating earnings by these segments life and disability operations registered increased earnings in 2002 and 2000 and decreased earnings in 2001 mostly as a result of varying benefit and claims costs the effective consolidated income tax rates were 29 9 in 2002 31 7 in 2001 and 30 7 in 2000 the effective tax rate was reduced and net earnings were enhanced by tax and related interest recoveries of 10 9 or 9 cents per share in 2002 from the favorable resolution of tax issues dating back to the company s 1987 tax return otherwise the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pretax operating income derived from partially tax sheltered investment income principally tax exempt interest on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains and underwriting and service income on the

         "item 7 management analysis of financial position and results of operations in millions except share data overview this analysis pertains to the consolidated accounts of old republic international corporation which are presented on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company conducts its business through four separate segments namely its general property and liability coverages mortgage guaranty title and life insurance groups this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes thereto included elsewhere in this document changes in accounting policies during the first quarter of 2002 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets under fas 142 goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized against operations but must be tested at least annually for possible impairment of their carrying values at december 31 2003 and 2002 the company s consolidated unamortized goodwill asset balance was 87 5 and the average annual charge from goodwill amortization to operating results for the three calendar years ended 2001 was approximately 4 0 or 2 cents per average diluted share the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test required by fas 142 in the first quarter of 2002 and determined that there was no indication of goodwill or intangible asset impairment during the first quarter of 2003 the company tested the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets and determined that there was no indication of impairment of such assets effective january 1 2003 the company elected to reclassify its fixed maturity securities categorized as held to maturity to the available for sale classification the securities involved are primarily utility and tax exempt bonds that accounted for approximately 34 percent of old republic s investment portfolio the decision was prompted by restrictive accounting rules affecting held to maturity investment securities the necessarily mechanical application of these rules can inhibit the corporation s ability to optimally manage its investments from a practical business point of view as of january 1 2003 the net impact of this reclassification on the corporation s balance sheet was to increase the carrying value of invested assets by 117 5 deferred tax liabilities by 41 1 and shareholders equity by 76 4 or approximately 42 cents per share as of december 31 2003 the net impact of this reclassification on the corporation s balance sheet is to increase the carrying value of invested assets by 99 2 deferred tax liabilities by 34 7 and shareholders equity by 64 5 or approximately 36 cents per share this change has no income statement impact no effect on old republic s ability to hold individual securities to maturity as it may deem appropriate and does not affect the company s necessary long term orientation in the management of its business going forward old republic s shareholders equity account could reflect somewhat greater period to period volatility as the entire bond note and stock investment portfolio will now be marked to market on a quarterly basis nevertheless the company believes that its ability to hold securities until they mature or until such other time when they can be sold opportunistically are much more significant and meaningful factors than the balance sheet or income statement effect of changes in market values at any point in time the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148 fas 148 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas no 123 for periods starting after december 15 2002 as of april 1 2003 the company adopted the requirements of fas 148 utilizing the prospective method under this method stock based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption for all other stock option awards outstanding the company continues to use the intrinsic value method permitted under existing accounting pronouncements in estimating the compensation cost of options the fair value of options has been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model expense recognition of stock options granted in 2003 reduced earnings per share by less than 1 cent per share financial position the company s financial position at december 31 2003 reflected increases in assets liabilities and common shareholders equity of 11 4 10 8 and 12 6 respectively when compared to the immediately preceding year end cash and invested assets represented 70 5 and 70 8 of consolidated assets as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively consolidated results produced positive and growing consolidated operating cash flows for the latest three years with the company s three largest operating segments providing substantially all such funds from operations in 2003 the invested asset base increased 11 0 to 6 849 2 principally as a result of such higher operating cash flow and the greater increase in fair value of investments resulting from the aforementioned reclassification of fixed maturity securities during 2003 and 2002 the corporation committed substantially all investable funds to short to intermediate term fixed maturity securities at both december 31 2003 and 2002 approximately 99 of the company s investments consisted of marketable securities including tax and loss bonds held by its mortgage guaranty subsidiaries which are redeemable by the u s treasury for tax purposes old republic continues to adhere to its long term policy of investing primarily in investment grade marketable securities investable funds have not been directed to so called junk bonds or types of securities categorized as derivatives old republic s commitment to equity securities during 2003 remained stable in relation to the related invested balance at 17 page year end 2002 this resulted mostly from sales of equity securities which were essentially offset by purchases and net unrealized gains on the remaining holdings at december 31 2003 the company had no fixed maturity investments in default as to principal and or interest relatively high short term maturity investment positions were maintained as of december 31 2003 and 2002 such investment positions reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate term factors including current operating needs expected operating cash flows and investment strategy considerations accordingly the future level of short term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may as a result increase or decrease from current levels the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio or reducing the cost of its debt obligations with regard to its equity portfolio the company does not own any options nor does it engage in any type of option writing traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of the invested assets base the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities reinvestment rate risk is reduced by concentrating on non callable issues and by taking asset liability matching considerations into account purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities which have variable principal prepayment options are generally avoided market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity the combination of these investment management practices is expected to produce a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive however to fluctuations in the level of interest rates but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments the impact of interest rate movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net unrealized gains or losses as a general rule rising interest rates enhance currently available yields but typically lead to a reduction in the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments by contrast a decline in such rates reduces currently available yields but usually serves to increase the fair value of the existing fixed maturity investment portfolio all such changes in fair value are reflected net of deferred income taxes directly in the shareholders equity account and as a component of the separate statement of comprehensive income given the company s inability to forecast or control the movement of interest rates old republic sets the maturity spectrum of its fixed maturity securities portfolio within parameters of estimated liability payouts and focuses the overall portfolio on high quality investments by so doing old republic believes it is reasonably assured of its ability to hold securities to maturity as it may deem necessary in changing environments and of ultimately recovering their aggregate cost possible future declines in fair values for old republic s bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the common shareholders equity account at any point in time but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses the company reviews the status and market value changes of each of its investments on at least a quarterly basis during the year and estimates of other than temporary impairments in the portfolio s value are evaluated and established at each quarterly balance sheet date in reviewing investments for other than temporary impairment the company in addition to a security s market price history considers the totality of such factors as the issuer s operating results financial condition and liquidity its ability to access capital markets credit rating trends most current audit opinion industry and securities markets conditions and analyst expectations to reach its conclusions sudden market value declines caused by such adverse developments as newly emerged or imminent bankruptcy filings issuer default on significant obligations or reports of financial accounting developments that bring into question the validity of previously reported earnings or financial condition are recognized as realized losses as soon as credible publicly available information emerges to confirm such developments accordingly the recognition of losses from other than temporary value impairments is subject to a great deal of judgment as well as turns of events over which the company can exercise little or no control in the event the company s estimate of other than temporary impairments is insufficient at any point in time future periods net income would be adversely affected by the recognition of additional realized or impairment losses but its financial position would not necessarily be affected adversely inasmuch as such losses or a portion of them could have been recognized previously as unrealized losses 18 page the following tables show certain information relating to the company s fixed maturity and equity portfolios as of the dates shown

represent significant percentages of assets shareholders equity or premium reserves the parent holding company meets its liquidity and capital needs principally through dividends paid by its subsidiaries the insurance subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they are domiciled the company can receive up to 321 2 in dividends from its subsidiaries in 2004 without the prior approval of regulatory authorities the liquidity achievable through such permitted dividend payments is more than adequate to cover the parent holding company s currently expected cash outflows represented mostly by interest on outstanding debt and quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders in addition old republic can access the commercial paper market for up to 150 0 to meet unanticipated liquidity needs during 2003 and 2002 the company used a part of available cash flow to redeem a portion of its commercial paper outstanding thereby reducing consolidated debt by approximately 1 0 and 15 0 respectively old republic s capitalization of 3 691 3 at december 31 2003 consisted of debt of 137 7 and common shareholders equity of 3 553 6 changes in the common shareholders equity account for the three most recent years reflect primarily the retention of earnings in excess of dividends declared on outstanding preferred and common shares and an increase in the value of investments carried at market values in may 2003 the company canceled 1 9 million common shares previously reported as treasury stock and restored them to unissued status this had no effect on total shareholders equity or the financial condition of the company at its march 2002 meeting

revenues are associated with the related benefits claims and expenses by means of the provision for policy benefits the deferral and subsequent amortization of applicable acquisition costs and the recognition of incurred benefits claims and operating expenses substantially all general insurance premiums are reflected in income on a pro rata basis earned but unbilled premiums are generally taken into income on the billing date while adjustments for retrospective premiums commissions and similar charges or credits are accrued on the basis of periodic evaluations of current underwriting experience and contractual obligations nearly all of the company s mortgage guaranty premiums stem from monthly installment policies accordingly such premiums are fully earned in the month they are reported and received with respect to minor numbers of annual or single premium policies earned premiums are largely recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies title premium and fee revenues stemming from the company s direct operations represent approximately 40 of such consolidated title business revenues such premiums are generally recognized as income at the escrow closing date which approximates the policy effective date fee income related to escrow and other closing services is recognized when the related services have been performed and completed the remaining 60 of consolidated title premium and fee revenues is produced by independent title agents and other service providers rather than making estimates that could be subject to significant variance from actual premium and fee production the company recognizes revenues from those sources upon receipt such receipts can reflect a three to four month lag relative to the effective date of the underlying title policy and are offset concurrently by production expenses and claim reserve provisions ordinary life insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due whereas premiums for other coverages such as credit life credit disability and health insurance are recognized as income on a pro rata sum of the years digits or combination of such methods as are deemed most applicable in the circumstances the composition of old republic s earned premiums and fees for the periods reported upon was as follows years ended december 31 2003 2002 2001 general insurance premiums 1 379 5 1 184 1 1 000 2 mortgage guaranty premiums 400 9 376 2 353 1 title insurance premiums and fees 1 103 8 813 4 625 3 life insurance premiums 51 6 50 1 50 6 consolidated premiums and fees 2 936 0 2 423 9 2 029 5 consolidated net premiums and fees earned increased by 21 1 19 4 and 16 9 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively earned premiums in the general insurance group increased 16 5 18 4 and 16 6 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively as a result of positive pricing and risk selection changes the company has effected during the past four years as well as additional business produced in an environment marked by a more restrictive marketing stance on the part of many competitors during 2002 and 2001 in particular old republic experienced greater success in retaining existing accounts and obtaining new accounts at generally rising prices mortgage guaranty premium income trends reflect greater sales opportunities arising from strong housing and mortgage lending markets offset in part by a high level of mortgage refinancing activity and a greater amount of reinsurance cessions high loan refinancing activity tends to reduce mortgage guaranty insurers policies in force and thus renewal premium production since previously insured mortgages may no longer require coverage or may become insured by competitors title group premium and fee revenues increased by 35 7 30 1 and 26 6 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these results reflect a continuation of favorable market conditions for the sale of new and used homes and most importantly strong 22 page mortgage refinancing activity driven by a fairly consistent drop in mortgage rates during the recent past life and disability premiums volume has continued to reflect the flattish trends of the past several years as growth for the company s limited product offerings has been inhibited by significant price competition among life and health insurers consolidated net investment income grew by 2 4 in 2003 was down 0 8 in 2002 and grew by 0 3 in 2001 for each of the past three years this revenue source was affected by a rising invested asset base caused by positive consolidated operating cash flows by a concentration of investable assets in interest bearing fixed maturity securities and by changes in market yields the average annual yield on investments was 4 7 5 1 and 5 6 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively yield trends reflect at once the relatively short maturity of old republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio a continuation of a progressively lower yield environment during the past three years and a moderate increase in equity investments which typically produce lower current yields in the form of cash dividends the company s investment policies have not been designed to maximize or emphasize the realization of investment gains rather these policies aim to assure a stable source of income from interest and dividends protect capital and provide sufficient liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future dispositions of fixed maturity securities arise mostly from scheduled maturities and early calls in 2003 2002 and 2001 70 2 74 9 and 88 7 respectively of all such dispositions resulted from these occurrences dispositions of equity securities at a realized gain or loss reflect such factors as ongoing assessments of issuers business prospects rotation among industry sectors and tax planning considerations additionally the amount of net realized gains and losses registered in any one accounting period are affected by the aforementioned assessments of securities values for other than temporary impairment as a result of the interaction of all these factors and considerations net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly from period to period and in the company s view are not indicative of any particular trend or result in its basic insurance underwriting business the following table reflects the composition of net realized gains or losses for the periods shown years ended december 31 2003 2002 2001 realized gains losses on disposition of fixed maturity securities 4 6 3 8 2 9 equity securities

7 net realized gains 19 3 13 9 29 7 expenses the insurance business is distinguished from most others in that the prices premiums charged for insurance coverages are set without clear knowledge of the claim costs that will ultimately emerge and be incurred often many years after issuance of a policy in order to achieve a necessary matching of revenues and expenses the company records in each accounting period the benefits claims and related settlement costs that have been incurred during the period such costs are affected by the adequacy of reserve estimates established for current and prior years claim occurrences the establishment of claim reserves by the company s insurance subsidiaries is a reasonably complex and dynamic process influenced by a large variety of factors these factors include past experience applicable to the anticipated costs of various types of claims continually evolving and changing legal theories emanating from the judicial system recurring accounting statistical and actuarial studies the professional experience and expertise of the company s claim departments personnel or attorneys and independent claim adjusters ongoing changes in claim frequency or severity patterns such as those caused by natural disasters illnesses accidents work related injuries and changes in general and industry specific economic conditions consequently the reserve setting process relies on management s judgments and the opinions of a large number of persons on the application and interpretation of historical precedent and trends and on expectations as to future developments at any point in time the company is exposed to possibly higher than anticipated claim costs due to all of these factors and to the evolution interpretation and expansion of tort law as well as the effects of unexpected jury verdicts all reserves are thus based on a large number of assumptions and resulting estimates which are periodically reviewed and evaluated in the light of emerging claim experience and changing circumstances the resulting changes in estimates are recorded in operations of the periods during which they are made the company believes that its overall reserving practices have been consistently applied over many years for at least the past ten years previously established reserves have produced reasonable estimates of the ultimate net costs of claims incurred however no representation is made that ultimate net claim and related costs will not develop in future years to be greater or lower than currently established reserve estimates in addition to the factors cited in the two preceding paragraphs certain events could impact adversely the company s reserve adequacy and its future operating results and financial condition with respect to old republic s 23 page general insurance business such events or exposures would include catastrophic workers compensation claims caused by a terrorist attack or a natural disaster such as an earthquake legislated retroactive incurrence of previously denied or settled claims the levying of major guaranty fund assessments by various states based on the costs of insurance company failures apportioned against remaining and financially secure insurers the future failure of one or more significant assuming reinsurers that would void or reduce the company s reinsurance recoverable for losses paid or in reserve and greater than expected involuntary market assessments such as those caused by forced participation in assigned risk and similar state plans all of which cannot be reasonably estimated prior to their emergence mortgage guaranty claim reserves could develop deficiently as a result of an unexpected rise in unemployment which might hinder borrowers ability to cure mortgage payment defaults significant declines in home prices could also have similarly adverse effects since salvage recoveries from the sale of properties obtained through foreclosures could be reduced title segment loss reserve levels could be impacted adversely by such developments as reduced loan refinancing activity whose effect could be to lengthen the period during which title policies remain exposed to loss emergence or reductions in either property values or the volume of transactions which by virtue of the speculative nature of some real estate developments could lead to increased occurrences of fraud defalcations or mechanics liens as to old republic s life and health segment reserve adequacy may be affected adversely by greater than anticipated medical care cost inflation as well as greater than expected frequency and severity of claims in management s opinion geographic concentrations of assureds employees in the path of an earthquake or acts of terrorism represent the most significant catastrophic risks to old republic s general insurance segment these risks would largely impact the workers compensation line since primary insurers such as the company must by regulation issue unlimited liability policies while old republic obtains a degree of protection through its reinsurance program as to earthquake exposures and until 2005 through the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 there is no assurance that recoveries thereunder would be sufficient to offset the costs of a major calamity nor eliminate its possible major impact on operating results and financial condition old republic has availed itself of modeling techniques to evaluate the possible magnitude of earthquake or terrorist induced claim costs for its most exposed coverage of workers compensation such models however have not been sufficiently validated by past occurrences and rely on a large variety and number of assumptions as a result they may not be predictive of possible claims from future events with respect to the company s mortgage guaranty business the most significant risk lies in the possibility of prolonged economic dislocations that would result in high unemployment levels and depressed property values conspiring to magnify loan default rates and resulting claim costs in title insurance the company s biggest exposure likely relates to defalcations and fraud which can result in significant aggregations of claims or non collection of insurance premiums in life insurance as in general insurance concentrations of insured lives coupled with a catastrophic event would represent the company s largest exposure in all of these regards current gaap accounting does not permit the company s reserving practices to anticipate and provide for these exposures before they occur most of old republic s consolidated claim and related expense reserves stem from its general insurance business at december 31 2003 such reserves accounted for 88 6 and 81 9 of consolidated gross and net of reinsurance reserves respectively the following table shows a breakdown of gross and net of reinsurance claim reserve estimates for major types of insurance

general insurance reserves amount 91 0 56 6 of total general insurance segment reserves 2 6 2 8 old republic s general insurance business is composed of a large variety of lines or classes of commercial insurance it has negligible exposure to personal lines such as homeowners or private passenger automobile insurance that exhibit wide diversification of risks significant frequency of claim occurrences and high degrees of statistical credibility most of the general insurance segment s claim reserves stem from liability insurance coverages for commercial customers liability claims typically require more extended periods of investigation and at times protracted litigation before they are finally settled and thus tend to exhibit loss development and payment patterns that stretch over relatively long periods of time the company establishes point estimates for most reserves on an insurance 24 page coverage line by line basis for individual subsidiaries sub classes or individual blocks of business that have similar attributes actuarially or otherwise derived ranges of reserve levels are not utilized in setting such reserves the reserves listed in the table above represent such point estimates accordingly the overall reserve level at any point in time represents the compilation of a very large number of reported case reserve estimates and the results of a variety of formula calculations intended to cover claims and related costs not as yet reported or emerged ibnr case reserves are based on continually evolving assessments of the facts available to the company during the claim settlement process long term disability type workers compensation reserves are discounted to present value based on interest rates ranging from 3 5 to 4 0 formula calculations are utilized and are intended to cover ibnr claim costs as well as additional costs that can arise from such factors as monetary and social inflation changes in claims administration processes changes in reinsurance ceded levels and expected trends in claim costs and related ratios typically such formulas take into account so called link ratios that represent prior years patterns of incurred or paid loss trends between succeeding years or past experience relative to progressions of the number of claims reported over time and ultimate average costs per claim reserves pertaining to large individual commercial insurance accounts that exhibit sufficient statistical credibility and that may be subject to retrospective premium rating plans or the utilization of varying levels or types of self insured retentions are established on an account by account basis using case reserves and applicable formula driven methods for certain so called long tail categories of insurance such as excess liability or excess workers compensation officers and directors liability and commercial umbrella liability relative to which claim development patterns are particularly long more volatile and immature in their early stages of development the company judgmentally establishes the most current accident years loss reserves on the basis of expected loss ratios as actual claims data emerges in succeeding years the original accident year loss ratio assumptions are validated or otherwise adjusted sequentially through the application of statistical or actuarial projection techniques such as the bornhuetter ferguson method which utilizes data from the more mature experience of prior years except for a small portion that emanates from ongoing primary insurance operations a substantial majority of the asbestosis and environmental a e claim reserves posted by old republic stem mainly from its participations in assumed reinsurance treaties and insurance pools substantially all such participations were discontinued fifteen or more years ago and have since been in run off status with respect to the primary portion of gross a e reserves old republic administers the related claims through its claims personnel as well as outside attorneys and posted reserves reflect its best estimates of ultimate claim costs claims administration for the assumed portion of the company s a e exposures is handled by the claims departments of unrelated primary or ceding reinsurance companies while the company performs periodic reviews of a portion of claim files so managed the overall a e reserves it establishes respond to the paid claim and case reserve activity reported to the company as well as available industry statistical data such as so called survival ratios such ratios represent the number of years average paid losses for the three or five most recent calendar years that are encompassed by an insurer s a e reserve level at any point in time according to this simplistic appraisal of an insurer s a e loss reserve level old republic s average five year survival ratios stood at 6 3 years gross and 9 8 years net of reinsurance as of december 31 2003 incurred net losses for asbestosis and environmental claims have averaged 1 2 of general insurance group incurred losses over the past five years mortgage guaranty loss reserves are based on calculations that take into account the number of reported insured mortgage loan defaults as of each balance sheet date as well as experience based estimates of loan defaults that have occurred but have not as yet been reported further the resulting loss reserve estimates take into account a large number of variables including trends in claim severity potential salvage recoveries expected cure rates for reported loan defaults at various stages of default and judgments relative to future employment levels housing market activity and mortgage loan demand and extensions title insurance and related escrow service loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established to cover the estimated settlement costs of known as well as claims incurred but not reported concurrently with the recognition of premium and escrow service revenues reserves for known claims are based on an assessment of the facts available to the company during the settlement process reserves for claims incurred but not reported are established on the basis of past experience and evaluations of such variables as changes and trends in the types of policies issued changes in real estate markets and interest rate environments and changed levels of loan refinancings all of which can have a bearing on the emergence number and ultimate cost of claims life and health insurance claim reserves also take into account estimates of the costs of settling known as well as incurred but not reported claims such estimates are based on an assessment of the facts available during the settlement process and past experience as to the emergence and severity of unreported claims in addition to the above reserve elements the company establishes reserves for loss settlement costs that are not directly related to individual claims such reserves are based on prior years experience and are intended to cover the unallocated costs of claim departments administration of known and ibnr claims substantially all of the company s reserves for ibnr claims relate to its general insurance business as of december 31 2003 the company s general insurance segment carried reserves of 595 1 to cover claims incurred but not as yet reported as well as possible adverse development of known cases as noted above the aggregate of these provisions known collectively as ibnr reserves 25 page results from the application of many formulas and reserve setting approaches that are sensitive to the wide variety of already enumerated factors should the reserves for ibnr claims be understated by 10 for a deficiency of 59 5 or 2 9 of the company s net general insurance reserves as of the most current year end the impact on the company s income statement would be to reduce pretax income by that amount while the company has not incurred such deficiency levels on reserves posted as of the 10 most recent year ends there can be no assurance that this experience will continue in the future the percentage of net benefits claims and related settlement expenses measured against premiums and related fee revenues of the company s operating segments were as follows years ended december 31 2003 2002 2001 general insurance group 67 8 72 6 75 3

2003 compared to 2002 which also reflected an improvement over 2001 the downtrend in this major cost factor reflects largely the aforementioned pricing and risk selection improvements effected in the past thirty six months or so the lower 2002 mortgage guaranty claims ratio results from a decline in claim provisions driven principally by a drop in expected claim severity while the increase in 2003 was driven mostly by higher claim frequencies a small increase in 2001 was largely the result of a moderately higher loan default rate factor the title insurance loss ratio has been in the low single digits in each of the past three years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity for business underwritten since 1992 in particular the uptrend in the 2003 and 2002 title insurance loss ratios stem from a rise in the net provision for ultimate claim costs from the historically low level achieved in 2001 old republic s life and health benefit and claims ratio though reasonably stable in the periods reported upon can vary widely from period to period due to the relatively small size of this segment s book of business and the material impact that even a slight change in frequency or severity of death and health claims can have the consolidated benefit and claim ratio reflects the changing effect of period to period contributions of each segment to consolidated results and this ratio s variances within each segment the company s mix of coverages industries served and long standing objective of assuring wide dispersion of risks in selected geographical areas minimized claim exposures related to the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on america the income statement for the year ended december 31 2001 nonetheless included charges aggregating approximately 4 0 to cover isolated property workers compensation trip delay and life insurance claims the resulting aggregate post tax charge of 2 6 reduced consolidated net income 1 cent per share the ratio of consolidated underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses to net premiums and fees earned was 48 5 in 2003 47 9 in 2002 and 46 5 in 2001 variations in these consolidated ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business in the company s four business segments the following table sets forth the expense ratios registered by each business segment for the periods shown years ended december 31 2003 2002 2001 general insurance group 25 5 25 8 26 7 mortgage guaranty group 24 8 32 3 27 5 title insurance group 84

in the general insurance group s expense ratio reflects the benefits of firm general expense management in the face of a greater revenue base the mortgage guaranty segment s expense ratio decreased in 2003 and 2001 due to greater efficiencies gained in the distribution and servicing of its products the increase in this ratio for 2002 was due to the posting of special operating charges aggregating 20 5 these charges stemmed from the cessation of the development and marketing of a loan portfolio evaluation service aimed at existing and potential mortgage guaranty insurance customers and a reassessment of certain class action litigation exposures the 2003 ratio also benefited from the resolution of the aforementioned class action litigation at a cost approximately 5 0 less than the related reserves recorded in 2002 increased title sales volume in 2003 2002 and 2001 led to a lower expense ratio for those years consumer and regulatory litigation affecting old republic s california title insurance subsidiary was responsible for expenses of 2 4 3 4 and 6 8 charged to 2003 2002 and 2001 operations respectively consolidated interest and other corporate charges decreased in 2003 due primarily to reduced interest costs on a slightly lower debt level pretax and net income consolidated pretax income increased by 21 2 11 3 and 18 2 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the following

underwriting experience produced by the above noted factors that affected loss and expense ratios further growth of mortgage guaranty income from underwriting and investments and accelerated growth in premiums and fees from greater refinancing activity which benefited the title insurance group in particular also led to greater contributions to consolidated pretax earnings by these segments life and disability operations registered increased earnings in 2002 and decreased earnings in 2003 and 2001 as a result of varying benefit and claims costs and in particular during 2003 a greater than average lapsation of certain term life policies issued in prior years and higher expense levels in travel related product areas the effective consolidated income tax rates were 32 3 in 2003 29 9 in 2002 and 31 7 in 2001 the effective tax rate was reduced and net earnings were enhanced by tax and related interest recoveries of 10 9 or 6 cents per share in 2002 from the favorable resolution of tax issues dating back to the company s 1987 tax return otherwise the rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pretax operating income derived from partially tax sheltered investment income principally tax exempt interest on the one hand and the combination of fully taxable investment income realized investment gains or losses and underwriting and service income on the other hand

inflation rates and periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters weather conditions accidents illnesses work related injuries and unanticipated external events mortgage guaranty and title insurance results can be impacted by similar factors and most particularly by changes in national and regional housing demand and values the availability and cost of

         "item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the company made the following acquisitions during the three years ended june 30 1998 on november 3 1995 the company purchased substantially all of the assets and business subject to certain liabilities of the estee corporation a manufacturer and marketer of sugar free and low sodium products targeted towards diabetic and health conscious consumers on march 31 1997 the company entered into a license agreement with weight watchers gourmet food company a wholly owned subsidiary of h j heinz company to manufacture market and sell weight watchers dry and refrigerated products on may 23 1997 the company purchased substantially all of the assets and business subject to certain liabilities of the boston popcorn company a manufacturer and marketer of popcorn and chip products principally in new england and the new york city metropolitan areas on july 15 1997 the company acquired alba foods from heinz usa a division of h j heinz company on october 14 1997 the company acquired all of the capital stock of westbrae natural inc westbrae on may 31 1998 the company acquired harry s premium snacks on june 1 1998 the company entered into a license agreement with h j heinz company to market and sell earth s best baby food products to natural food stores results of operations the following discussion does not give effect to the acquisitions of arrowhead mills deboles terra chips and garden of eatin inc the acquisitions all of which occurred on july 1 1998 after the close of the company s fiscal year the acquisitions will be accounted for as purchases accordingly the results of operations of the acquired businesses will be included in the company s results of operations commencing july 1 1998 fiscal 1998 compared to fiscal 1997 page net sales for 1998 increased by approximately 38 9 million to 104 3 million as compared with 65 4 million in 1997 sales of westbrae accounted for a substantial portion of the increase gross profit for 1998 increased by approximately 17 9 million to 42 5 million 40 7 of sales as compared to 24 6 million 37 6 of sales in 1997 the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable largely to the increased sales level in 1998 the increase in the gross margin percentage was attributable principally to a reduction in warehousing and delivery costs as a percentage of sales and the effect of the westbrae acquisition selling general and administrative expenses increased by 10 8 million to 30 4 million 29 2 of sales in 1998 as compared with 19 7 million 30 1 of sales in 1997 substantially all of the dollar increase was attributable to the acquisition of westbrae the 0 9 reduction in such costs as a percentage of sales was attributable principally to higher sales levels which have the impact of better absorption of general operating costs depreciation and amortization costs increased to 1 6 million in 1998 from 0 9 million in 1997 the principal factor contributing to in the increase was amortization of goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of westbrae and the other businesses during the past three fiscal years interest and financing costs for 1998 amounted to 2 6 million in 1998 as compared with 2 1 million in 1997 in october 1997 the company acquired westbrae principally with the proceeds of bank borrowings in december 1997 the company issued 2 5 million shares of common stock in a public offering the proceeds of which were used to pay down a substantial portion of the debt incurred in connection with the westbrae acquisition accordingly between october 14 1997 and december 9 1997 there was a higher level of debt which accounted for most of the increase in interest expense in april 1998 the company prepaid 8 5 million of its 12 5 subordinated debentures with the proceeds of less costly bank borrowings this prepayment will result in lower interest costs subsequent to the prepayment income before income taxes and extraordinary charge for 1998 increased to 7 9 million 7 6 of sales from 1 9 million 2 8 of sales in 1997 this significant improvement in profitability was attributable to the aforementioned increase in sales the improvement in gross profit margins lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales offset by the increase in amortization of goodwill and interest costs income taxes increased to 3 3 million in 1998 compared with 0 8 million in 1997 the effective tax rate was 41 2 in 1998 compared with 42 4 in 1997 the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a higher level of income in 1998 that mitigated the effect of the non deductibility of goodwill amortization in connection with the acquisitions on july 1 1998 referred to above the company acquired a very substantial amount of goodwill attributable to the brand equity and earnings of the acquired businesses inasmuch as the amortization of such goodwill will not be deductible for tax reporting purposes the company anticipates that its effective income tax rate in the fiscal year ending june 30 1999 will approximate 44 page extraordinary charge in connection with the prepayment of its 12 5 subordinated debentures the company paid prepayment fees and also wrote off unamortized financing costs associated therewith this resulted in an extraordinary charge of approximately 2 1 million before related income tax benefits of approximately 0 8 million fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 net sales for 1997 decreased by approximately 3 3 million to 65 4 million as compared with 68 6 million in 1996 the sales decrease was principally attributable to a 10 5 million decrease in sales of rice cake products offset in part by a full year of sales of the estee division which was acquired in november 1995 and sales of weight watchers products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 the rice cake product category for the company as well as other sellers of the product including quaker oats has been under recent pressure from the growing market acceptance of other snack products and from increased competition the company has reacted by continuing to introduce new products in a variety of categories and continues to make acquisitions that will diversify its product mix and reduce reliance on sales of specific categories gross profit for 1997 decreased by approximately 3 1 million to 24 6 million as compared to 27 7 million in 1996 gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 2 8 in 1997 compared with 1996 principally due to a change in product mix and an increase in warehousing and delivery costs selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 1 3 million to 19 7 million in 1997 as compared to 20 9 million in 1996 principally as a result of lower sales promotional costs on lower sales levels such expenses as a percentage of net sales were at the same approximate level in both years interest and financing costs for 1997 decreased by 0 1 million to 2 1 million as compared to 2 2 million for 1996 income before income taxes for 1997 was approximately 1 9 million as compared to 3 8 million in 1996 the decrease of 1 9 million was principally a result of the aforementioned decrease in gross profit offset in part by the decrease in sales promotional costs income taxes decreased to 0 8 million in 1997 from 1 6 million in 1996 the decrease in income taxes is substantially attributable to the decrease in income before taxes income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income amounted to 42 4 in 1997 as compared to 43 3 in 1996 page liquidity and capital resources in october 1997 in connection with the acquisition of westbrae the company entered into an amended and restated credit facility facility with its bank providing for a 30 million senior term loan and a 10 million revolving credit line the facility replaced the company s existing facility with the same bank in december 1997 the company issued 2 5 million shares of common stock in a public offering which raised approximately 20 9 million which was used to pay down the senior term loan in april 1998 the company re borrowed approximately 9 million under the senior term loan to prepay the company s 8 5 million subordinated debentures at june 30 1998 18 6 million was outstanding under the senior term loan and 2 4 million was outstanding under the revolving credit line on july 1 1998 in connection with the acquisitions the facility was further amended to provide for a 60 million senior term loan and a 15 million revolving credit line the entire senior term loan was borrowed on that date to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions fund closing costs and to repay the then existing balance on the facility accordingly the company s debt structure will be significantly different in the fiscal year commencing july 1 1998 from that in prior years however the company believes that operating cash flow generated by its business will be more than adequate to service the aforementioned debt the interest rate on the facility is based partially on the ratio of outstanding debt to operating cash flow as defined the company may elect to pay interest based on the bank s base rate or the libor rate borrowings on a base rate basis may range from 0 50 below the bank s base rate to 1 00 above the bank s base rate borrowings on a libor basis may range from 1 75 to 3 00 over the libor rate the entire senior term loan is currently borrowed on a libor basis the senior term loan is repayable in quarterly principal installments the first principal payment commences on december 31 1998 through maturity of the facility on september 30 2005 pursuant to the facility the company may borrow under its revolving credit line up to 85 of eligible trade receivables and 60 of eligible inventories amounts outstanding under the facility are collateralized by principally all of the company s assets the facility also contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants as of august 31 1998 13 million was available under the company s revolving credit line utilization of the revolving credit line varies over the course of the year based on inventory requirements the aggregate principal payments on the senior term loan for the year ending june 30 1999 are approximately 2 6 million the company anticipates that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of its debt service and operating requirements page working capital at june 30 1998 amounted to approximately 14 5 million working capital increased by approximately 4 million on july 1 1998 as a result of the acquisitions and this new level of working capital is deemed adequate to serve the company s operational needs prior to the acquisitions the company purchased all of its products from independent co packers and did not invest in plant or equipment relating to the manufacture of products for sale the company has not as yet determined whether it will continue production at the plants acquired in the acquisitions or will delegate such production to independent co packers consequently there may be some level of capital expenditures in connection with the operation of those plants but the amount is not considered material in relation to the company s operations the facility imposes limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and requires that the company comply with certain financial tests and restrictive covenants as at june 30 1998 the company was in compliance with such covenants year 2000 the year 2000 issue is the result of computer systems that were programmed in prior years using a two digit representation for the year consequently in the year 2000 date sensitive computer programs may interpret the date 00 as 1900 rather than 2000 the company has completed an assessment of its system affected by the year 2000 issue and have found only minor issues to be addressed the business operation computer programs systems are year 2000 compliant the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year 2000 issues while the company believes that the year 2000 issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position liquidity or results of operations there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems seasonality sales of food products consumed in the home generally decline to some degree during the summer vacation months however the company believes that such seasonality has a limited effect on operations page inflation the company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented ",

had previously operated independently and the company s future success is dependent upon among other things its ability to realize potential available marketing opportunities and cost savings from the integration of hain and celestial in addition as discussed 17 page in the joint proxy statement prospectus the integration of hain and celestial may distract management from the day to day operations of the company s business the company s financial results discussed below reflect the financial impact of the merger during fiscal 2000 as discussed the company plans to complete the integration process during fiscal 2001 and as described above plans to continue to evaluate other potential acquisition candidates as part of its overall growth strategy results of operations fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 net sales for fiscal 2000 were 403 5 million an increase of 28 over net sales of 315 8 million 81 of the increase was derived from net sales of acquired businesses or net sales resulting from licensing agreements entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 the remainder of the increase was derived from internal growth primarily from the non dairy beverages of westsoy and terra chips gross profit for 2000 increased by 29 4 million to 176 1 million 43 6 of net sales as compared to 146 7 million 46 4 of net sales the increase in gross profit dollars was a direct result of increased sales levels in 2000 the decline in gross profit percentage was due to a combination of changes in sales mix additional write offs and reserves associated with the previously announced decision to cease production of the 30 count supplement product line as well as certain reserves related to expected returns of the 60 count supplement product line the write off of certain inventories including raw materials and packaging related to the company s decision to discontinue certain items inefficiencies within certain co packers additional freight costs incurred due to fuel surcharges assessed to the company that were not passed onto customers and higher warehouse costs primarily a result of the transition to our new west coast consolidated warehouse selling general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 36 3 million to 148 1 million in 2000 as compared to 111 8 million in 1999 such expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to 36 7 in 2000 compared with 35 4 in 1999 the increase of 1 3 is due to 2 of higher trade promotional expenses over expected amounts offset by approximately a 1 improvement in other selling general and administrative component costs resulting from the realization of reduced administrative expenses from integration of certain operations of the acquired businesses within the company s infrastructure while significant headway has been made in the integration process not all of the company s administrative functions of the businesses acquired during fiscal 1999 as well as the merger in may 2000 have as yet been integrated it is expected that the integration process will continue through the end of fiscal 2001 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the company recorded charges of 15 6 3 7 and 3 5 million before taxes related to merger related charges associated with the merger costs for restructuring certain non core businesses and the consolidation of warehouse and information systems within the company s distribution and operating network and impaired long lived assets principally goodwill and other long term assets associated with its supplement product line respectively included in both the fiscal 2000 and 1999 periods within restructuring and other nonrecurring charges is a 18 page september 1999 1 2 million settlement agreement relating to a shareholder lawsuit the components of the 3 7 million restructuring charge are approximately 2 0 million of write downs of fixed and other assets 1 2 million for lease exit and related incremental costs 2 million for severance and related benefits associated with the consolidation and closure of certain warehouses and streamlining certain business costs at june 30 2000 no amounts have been charged against the accrual provided amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased from 4 8 million in 1999 to 6 3 million in fiscal 2000 the increase of 1 5 million is attributable to goodwill and other intangibles principally trademarks in connection with the acquisitions during fiscal 1999 and 2000 operating income decreased from 28 9 million in 1999 to a loss of 2 4 million in 2000 the decrease was due to the aforementioned decline in gross profit and increase in selling general and administrative dollars along with the 22 8 million of merger restructuring and impairment of long lived asset charges recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 as well as increased amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets the company s other income in fiscal 2000 there was no other income in the comparable period primarily resulted from gains on proceeds received from sale of assets 9 million along with investment gains of 7 million on marketable securities bought and sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2000 interest and finance costs increased from 6 4 million in 1999 to 6 7 million in fiscal 2000 the increase of 3 million was due to the debt incurred in connection with the fiscal 1999 acquisitions offset by the september 1999 and june 2000 75 million and 44 million respectively repayments on this debt as more fully described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the infusion of equity has enabled the company to achieve a debt to equity ratio of 2 at june 30 2000 income before income taxes extraordinary item and cumulative change in accounting principle decreased from 22 4 million in 1999 to a loss of 7 5 million in 2000 this 30 million decrease is a result of the aforementioned decline in operating income offset by higher other income during fiscal 2000 the company recorded a 3 9 million 52 tax provision on a pre tax loss of 7 5 million as compared to a tax provision of 8 9 million 40 on a pre tax income of 22 4 million during 1999 the fiscal 2000 tax expense even though there was a pre tax loss was primarily a result of the add back of nondeductible merger and asset write down charges along with higher nondeductible goodwill amortization brought on by the 1999 acquisitions extraordinary charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the company recorded a 1 9 million net of tax benefit of 1 2 million extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of the company s existing credit facility and the write off of the related debt financing costs 19 page change in accounting principle in april 1998 the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position 98 5 reporting costs of start up activities sop 98 5 sop 98 5 became effective beginning on july 1 1999 and required the start up costs capitalized prior to such date to be written off as a cumulative effect of an accounting change as of july 1 1999 any future start up costs are to be expensed as incurred start up activities are broadly defined as those one time activities related to introducing a new product or service conducting business in a new territory conducting business with a new class of customer or commencing some new operation in accordance with sop 98 5 the company recorded a one time non cash charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 reflecting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the amount of 3 8 million net of tax benefit representing such start up costs capitalized as of the beginning of fiscal year 2000 fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 net sales for fiscal 1999 were 315 8 million an increase of 53 over net sales of 206 5 million in fiscal 1998 87 of the increase was derived from revenues of acquired businesses or revenues resulting from licensing agreements entered into during fiscal 1999 with the remaining 13 coming from internal growth primarily non dairy soy beverages terra chips and green and wellness tea products offset by decreases in celestial s supplement product line gross profit for 1999 increased by approximately 38 7 million to 146 7 million 46 4 of net sales as compared to 108 million 52 3 of net sales in 1998 the increase in gross profit dollars was a direct result from the increased sales level in 1999 the decline in the gross profit percentage was due to sales mix and decreased margins of celestial supplements product lines associated with high manufacturing costs for inventory write downs selling general and administrative expenses increased by 28 3 million to 111 8 million in 1999 as compared to 83 5 million in 1998 such expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to 35 4 in 1999 compared with 40 4 in the 1998 period the improvement of 5 results from certain of the acquired businesses having lower selling expenses than the company s other product lines and the realization of reduced administrative expenses from integration of certain operations of the acquired businesses within the company s existing infrastructure amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 2 2 million from 1998 to 1999 all of this increase was attributable to amortization of goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisitions during fiscal 1999 amortization expense amounted to 1 5 of net sales in 1999 compared with 1 3 in 1998 operating income increased by 7 million compared to the 1998 period approximately 95 of the increase was derived from higher sales volume due to the businesses acquired in 1999 operating income as a percentage of net sales amounted to 9 1 a decrease of 1 5 over the 1998 period this resulted principally from lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales higher goodwill amortization resulting from the acquisitions offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20 page interest and financing costs for 1999 amounted to 6 4 million an increase of 3 2 million over the 1998 period the increase was due to the debt incurred in connection with the fiscal year 1999 acquisitions partially offset by reduced interest costs resulting from the prepayment in april 1998 of the company s then 12 5 subordinated debentures the debentures were retired with the proceeds of senior debt carrying an interest rate of approximately 7 8 income before income taxes for 1999 increased to 22 4 million 7 1 of net sales from 18 7 million 9 1 of net sales in 1998 this decline in profitability as a percentage of net sales was attributable to the aforementioned decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales and higher interest costs income taxes increased to 8 9 million in 1999 compared to 7 3 million in 1998 the effective tax rate was 40 in 1999 compared with 39 in 1998 approximately 8 of the increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the higher federal statutory rate resulting from the company s higher level of income with approximately a 8 increase in the amortization of nondeductible goodwill arising from current year acquisitions offsetting these increases was the availability of additional tax deductions generated from the company s contributions of 30 count supplements to a qualified organization income before extraordinary item for 1999 increased by 2 1 million over 1998 and amounted to 4 3 of net sales compared with 5 5 in the 1998 period the decrease as a percentage of net sales was a result of a lower level of operating income discussed above offset by higher interest costs and higher effective tax rates in addition in 1998 the company recorded an extraordinary charge of 1 3 million net of tax benefit resulting from the aforementioned prepayment of its 12 5 subordinated debentures in april 1998 liquidity and capital resources the company requires liquidity for working capital needs and debt service requirements the company had working capital and a current ratio of 89 8 million and 2 69 to 1 respectively at june 30 2000 as compared to 38 million and 1 67 to 1 respectively at june 30 1999 the increase in working capital and the current ratio is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the company s private equity stock offering which allowed the company to paydown its senior term loans in addition to the private equity stock offering which is discussed below the company has increased its working capital due to cash flow provided by operations the company has reduced its days sales outstanding from 41 days in 1999 to 35 days in 2000 the improvement is a result of certain acquired businesses having days sales outstanding lower than the historical levels and improved credit and collection efforts the increase in inventories which were financed by the company s operating cash flows in 2000 are due to the company s need to hold inventory for increasing sales the inventory turnover rate improved from 4 4 in 1999 to 5 2 in 2000 the company expects inventory turnover to remain consistent with that of 2000 on may 18 1999 in connection with the acquisition of nng the company arranged for a 160 million senior secured loan facility amended facility which provided for a 30 million credit facility and 130 million of term loans this amended facility was used to complete the acquisition of nng refinance the company s then existing indebtedness 57 3 21 page million and provide for ongoing working capital needs under the

stock par value 01 per share a wholly owned subsidiary of heinz the heinz subsidiary for an aggregate purchase price of 82 4 million under a securities purchase agreement dated september 24 1999 between the company and the heinz subsidiary the company used 75 million of the proceeds from this private equity offering to reduce its borrowings under its debt facility the remainder of the proceeds were used to pay transaction costs included as part of the alliance was a provision that heinz would have the preemptive right to purchase additional equity in the company to maintain it s

44 million of the proceeds from this private equity offering to repay the remainder of its borrowings under its debt facility the remainder of the funds are invested at june 30 2000 the company believes its cash on hand of 38 3 million at june 30 2000 as well as cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund its working capital needs anticipated capital expenditures other operating expenses as well as provide liquidity to pay down the remaining merger related and restructuring accruals aggregating 13 million existing at june 30 2000 of which approximately 12 million will be utilized during fiscal 2001 the company is currently investing its cash on hand in highly liquid short term investments yielding approximately 6 interest in addition in july 2000 the company entered

merger costs restructuring and other non recurring charges and impairment of long lived assets the company recorded an additional 2 5 million of costs associated with celestial s previously announced decision to cease production of its 30 count supplement product line at september 30 1999 as well as certain reserves related to expected returns of the company s 60 count supplement sales these decisions were primarily related to a management change along with prevailing market conditions affecting the supplement industry shortly after the merger was consummated on may 30 2000 the company initiated a program to reduce the amount of tea inventory in the hands of distributors by changing celestial s trade practices during the fourth quarter this program reduced celestial s revenue by an estimated 450 000 cases or approximately 9 6 million resulting in lower operating profit by approximately 4 8 million in addition during the period after announcement of the merger an environment of significant uncertainty regarding integration 23 page of the companies existed within the company s sales organization as well as within the company s customer base the company believes that this uncertainty further impacted revenue from non core brands thereby reducing operating profit by approximately 2 3 million the company was also impacted by lower revenues from earth s best products as a result of the lack of availability of certain ingredients the company anticipated resolving this issue by early june 2000 however the problems were not fully resolved until shortly after fiscal year end in addition during the fourth quarter the company incurred approximately 8 3 million of trade promotional expenses over expected amounts these costs were primarily due to 1 a concerted effort to gain additional distribution 2 increased deductions by customers in the face of our announced merger these deductions are currently being researched and discussed with customers and although there can be no assurance of such may result in future collections 3 a higher level of actual spending over amounts estimated and accrued by celestial at march 31 2000 and 4 the implementation of a new trade promotion tracking system at celestial which has accelerated the availability of information and allowed the company to better match these costs with related revenues gross profit margin was negatively impacted by approximately 3 1 million primarily due to 1 a change in sales mix 2 the write off of certain inventories including raw materials and packaging related to the company s decision to discontinue certain items 3 inefficiencies within certain co packers 4 additional freight costs incurred due to fuel surcharges assessed to the company that were not passed onto customers and 5 higher warehouse costs primarily due to increased inventory levels in anticipation of a new distribution agreement for the company s medically directed products together with the transition to the

increased to 123 646 or 53 3 of revenues from 105 972 or 54 8 of revenues in fiscal 1996 the 1 5 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to the impact of a stronger us dollar in fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 resulting in an unfavorable impact from the revaluation of foreign denominated intercompany receivables excluding the impact of revaluing the intercompany receivables the gross profit margin remained relatively constant at 53 6 in fiscal 1997 compared to 53 9 in fiscal 1996 selling general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal 1997 were 74 094 or 31 9 of revenues an increase of 9 827 over sg a expenses of 64 267 or 33 2 of revenues in fiscal 1996 the majority of the dollar increase was due to increased worldwide marketing expenditures and personnel costs primarily at the international locations sg a expenses included approximately 1 600 relating to sg a expenses in australia which were more than offset by approximately 2 100 relating to the favorable translation currency impact on expenses sg a expense decreased as a percentage of revenues due to the leveraging of the company s existing cost structure and the improvement in the

its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future year 2000 costs the year 2000 issue refers to the potential for disruption to business activities caused by system and processing failures of date related calculations and is the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year for example computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using 00 as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000 this could result in system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations including among other things a temporary inability to process transactions send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities to date the company has not experienced any business disruptions related to the year 2000 additionally the company has no reason to believe that any third parties with whom it deals has had any material year 2000 issues however the company cannot give assurance that it will not experience

taxes 92 14 7 provision benefit for income taxes 36 2 net income loss 56 14 5 net sales total revenue in fiscal 2000 increased to 122 7 million or 37 from 89 3 million reported in fiscal 1999 the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in unit volume shipments of notebook products having higher average selling prices asps as well as a 5 0 million payment from via relating to royalty and license revenue sales of portable products of 91 9 million were approximately 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2000 as compared to 51 4 million or 58 of net sales in fiscal 1999 sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately 21 9 million or 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2000 as compared to approximately 33 8 million or 38 in fiscal 1999 net sales in fiscal 1999 decreased to 89 3 million or 21 from 113 0 million reported in fiscal 1998 the decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreases in unit volume shipments of approximately 30 of graphical user interface gui accelerators and graphics controllers and a decline in average selling prices asps in the desktop area in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998 sales of portable products of 51 4 million were approximately 58 of our net sales in fiscal 1999 as compared to 44 9 million or 40 of net sales in fiscal 1998 sales of gui accelerator desktop products were approximately 33 8 million or 38 of our net sales in fiscal 1999 as compared to approximately 64 0 million or 57 in fiscal 1998 15 page 16 we design products with the goal of filling the needs of leading pc systems manufacturers as well as the needs of adapter card manufacturers sales to leading pc systems manufacturers represented approximately 46 of net sales for fiscal 2000 an increase from 26 in fiscal 1999 and an increase from 25 in fiscal 1998 sales to asian customers primarily in hong kong taiwan korea japan and singapore accounted for 99 73 and 84 of net sales in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively sales to three customers compaq fujitsu and toshiba accounted for approximately 18 11 and 10 of net sales for fiscal 2000 respectively sales to two customers fujitsu and innoquest accounted for approximately 13 and 12 of net sales for fiscal 1999 respectively and sales to two customers union computer and fujitsu accounted for approximately 15 and 11 of net sales for fiscal 1998 respectively substantially all of the sales transactions were denominated in u s dollars during all periods we derive a portion of our revenues from sales to distributors sales to distributors represented 6 12 and 17 of net sales during the twelve months ended june 30 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively during the first half of fiscal year 1998 the company experienced higher than usual returns resulting from certain distributors adjusting their inventory mix and levels we plan to develop new and higher performance graphics controllers and multimedia products to sell to existing customers as well as new customers in asia north america and europe our future success depends upon our successful introduction of these and other new products on a regular and timely basis and upon those products meeting customer requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development of new products or to commence shipments of new products in a timely manner or that product specifications will not change during the development period in addition even if such new products are successfully developed and shipped there can be no assurance that they will be successfully developed and shipped and there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the marketplace gross margin gross margin increased to 33 in fiscal 2000 from 32 in fiscal 1999 our gross margin was higher in fiscal 2000 primarily due to the booking of 5 0 million royalty and license revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 without the royalty and license revenue our gross margin would have decreased by 2 in fiscal 2000 the 2 decrease was primarily due to an increase in the cost of embedded dram our gross margin decreased to 32 in fiscal 1999 from 33 in fiscal 1998 gross margins were generally lower in fiscal 1999 because of decreasing prices in desktop computers and an increase in the cost of embedded dram for portable computers we believe that the prices of high technology products decline over time as competition increases and new advanced products are introduced we expect asps of existing products to continue to decline although the asps of our entire product line may remain constant or increase as a result of introductions of new higher performance products often with additional functionality which are planned to be sold at higher prices our strategy is to maintain and improve gross margins by 1 developing new products that have higher margins and migration to new process technology and 2 reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yield and utilizing newer process technology there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs research and development research and development expenditures increased to 27 6 million in fiscal 2000 from 26 3 million in fiscal 1999 and decreased from 28 2 million in fiscal 1998 research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales were 22 29 and 25 in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively the increase in expenditures in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily the result of an increase in non recurring engineering charges and an increase in headcount in our overseas research and development facility the decrease in expenditures in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 was primarily due to our cost reduction efforts in fiscal 1999 we continue to develop a dptv tm dx product for the digital television market in china japan and korea we plan to continue developing the next generation dptv tm product as well as other advanced products for digital tv and digital stb however there can be no assurance that these products will be quickly or widely 16 page 17 accepted by consumers in the market place nor that the new products will be developed and shipped in a timely manner selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenditures increased to 16 9 million in fiscal 2000 from 16 6 million in fiscal 1999 and were 19 0 million in fiscal 1998 selling general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales were 14 19 and 17 in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively selling expenditures were 9 7 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to 10 9 million and 13 5 million in fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively general and administrative expenditures were 7 2 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to 5 7 million and 5 5 million in fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively selling cost have declined in fiscal 2000 due to a decline in headcount and sales representative commissions selling costs have declined in fiscal years 1999 and 1998 due to the slow down in personal computer sales and reductions in marketing personnel general and administrative expenditures have increased in fiscal year s 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 primarily due to an increase in legal services interest income net the amount of interest income earned by us varies directly with the amount of its cash cash equivalents short term investments and the prevailing interest rates net interest income remained flat at 2 0 million in both fiscal 2000 and in fiscal 1999 net interest income decreased to 2 0 million in fiscal 1999 from 2 4 million in fiscal 1998 due to lower cash balances in higher yielding short term investments provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to 44 7 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2000 due to the recording of tax provision for the umc non recurring gain in the long term investment in umc other income in august 1995 we made an investment of 49 3 million in united integrated circuits corporation uicc on january 3 2000 united microelectronics corporation umc acquired uicc as a result of this merger and a 20 stock dividend payable to shareholders of record may 16 2000 we now own approximately 55 8 million shares of umc accordingly we reported a pretax gain of 117 million as other income in our statement of operations for the quarter end june 30 2000 the gain represents the difference between the cost of our previous investment in uicc and the quoted market price of the umc shares on the taiwan stock exchange as of the date that umc acquired uicc during march 2000 an investment in rise technology in the amount of 2 million was deemed unrecoverable by our management and written off therefore net gain on investments for the twelve months ended june 30 2000 equals 115 million under sfas no 130 reporting comprehensive income sfas 130 any unrealized gains or losses on our short term investments are to be reported as a separate adjustment to equity accumulated other comprehensive income on the short term portion of our umc investment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2000 was an unrealized loss of 4 6 million other comprehensive income on the short term portion of our umc investment will be recomputed quarterly and will fluctuate with market and industry conditions and therefore could result in material losses or gains in any quarter 17 page 18 factors that may affect our results operating loss in fiscal year 2000 we have experienced operating losses for the fiscal year s ending june 30 2000 future performance will substantially depend upon numerous factors such as timely introduction of new products and product enhancements to the marketplace whether customers successfully incorporate our technologies into end products with high levels of customer acceptance fluctuating price levels for our products trident s management is trying to expedite new product launching and to control operating expenses however there is no guarantee that management s efforts will be successful sales and marketing product development and general and administrative expenses may increase as a result of shifts in the market place and the company s need to respond to these shifts which could result in the need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability fluctuations in quarterly results we plan to control our operating expenses related to any expansion of our sales and marketing activities broadening of our customer support capabilities developing new distribution channels and any increase in our research and development capabilities however our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including fluctuations in demand for our products including seasonality unexpected product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders our ability to develop introduce ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions new product introductions by our competitors our ability to achieve required cost reductions our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products delayed new product introductions unfavorable responses to new products adverse economic conditions particularly in asia the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold and availability of foundry and assembly capacities delay of joint development efforts due to unexpected market conditions reliance on few key accounts to date a limited number of distributors and customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue if any of our large distributors or customers stops or delays purchases our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected although our largest customers may vary from period to period we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers particularly in light of the high sales price per unit of our portable products and the length of our sales cycles our original equipment manufacturer oem customers seldom release quarterly purchase orders and six month rolling forecasts in addition our financial performance depends on large orders from a few key distributors and other significant customers we do not have binding long term commitments from any of them for example 18 page 19 our oem customers can stop purchasing and our distributors can stop marketing our products with thirty days notice our distributor agreements generally are not exclusive and the distributors have no obligation to renew agreements and our distributor agreements generally do not require minimum purchases we have established a reserve program which under specified conditions enables distributors to return products to us the amount of potential product returns is estimated and provided for in the period of the sale actual returns could differ from our estimates reliance on international sales although our revenues have historically been generated primarily from asian customers primarily taiwan and japan we will continue to exert efforts to expand our revenue base among the leading north american oems and odms our ability to grow will depend in part on this expansion in north america but will continue to be heavily based on international sales and operations particularly taiwan japan and china which are expected to constitute a significant portion of our sales in the future in addition there are a number of risks arising from our international business including potentially longer accounts receivable collection cycles import or export licensing requirements potential adverse tax consequences and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements our international sales currently are u s dollar denominated as a result an increase in the value of the u s dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets intense competition in the market for graphics controllers the graphics controller industry in the sub 1 000 pc segment has experienced reduced margins due to a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures increasing wafer cost and rapid technological change we anticipated that the discrete graphics controller demand from sub 1 000 pc s will continuously decrease in the future while the demand for integrated graphics controllers will increase therefore to maintain our revenue and gross margin we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product cost our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline which could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results the market for graphics controllers is intensely competitive many of our current competitors in graphics have substantially greater financial technical sales marketing and other resources as well as greater name recognition and market share than we do to remain competitive we believe we must among other things invest significant resources in developing new products including products for new markets increasing the ability of our products to integrate various functions and enhancing quality product performance if we fail to do so our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors which could have a materially adverse affect on our revenue and future profitability we have developed a dptv tm dx product for the digital television market in china japan and korea however we believe the market for digital television will be intensely competitive and we will require substantial research development sales and other expenditures to stay competitive in this market 19 page 20 vulnerable to undetected product problems although we establish and implement test specifications impose quality standards upon our suppliers and perform separate application based compatibility and system testing our products may contain undetected defects which may or may not be material and which may or may not have a feasible solution we have experienced such errors in the past and we can t ensure that such errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments these problems may materially adversely affect our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and causing significant customer relations problems in part due to pricing and other pressures in the pc graphics market and in the desktop market in particular we are developing products for introduction in non pc markets however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in eliminating undetected defects in these new products which may or may not be material dependance on independent foundries if the demand for our products grows we will need to increase our material purchases contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue adversely affect our competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers we currently rely on a limited number of third party foundries to manufacture our products either in finished form or wafer form generally these foundries are not obligated to manufacture our products on a long term fixed price base however due to the company s investment in one foundry a certain level of guaranteed wafer capacity does exist if we encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components our ability to meet customer orders could be materially adversely affected we have experienced a delay in product shipments from a contract manufacturer in the past which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers such delays often result in purchasing at a higher per unit product cost from other foundries or the payment of expediting charges so that we can obtain the required supply in a timely manner we may in the future experience delays in shipments from foundries or other problems such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results there can be no assurance that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition unstable stock price the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors such as new product announcements by trident or our competitors quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and unfavorable conditions in the graphics controller market may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock these conditions as well as factors that generally affect the market for stocks in general and stock in high technology companies in particular could cause the price of trident s stock to fluctuate from time to time potential dilution of shareholders interest as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that would complement our current product offerings augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities we are very aggressively seeking investments opportunities in new 20 page 21 businesses and we expect to make investments in and may acquire businesses products or technologies in the future in the event of any future acquisitions we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership these actions by us could materially adversely affect our operating results and or the price of our common stock acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations technologies or products unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risk associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses products technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business operation results and financial condition we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments we have invested in numerous privately held companies many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies our exposure to fluctuating market conditions could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition uncertainty of business restructuring continuing the strategic expansion into the internet appliance and digital tv marketplace trident is now structured into two business units the videographics communications business unit and the digital media business unit the videographics communications business unit continues the company s entire 3d videographics business with worldwide pc oems and intends to explore and expand into system on chip soc solutions for internet appliances and visual video communication it is under the management of frank lin as business unit president on the other hand the company s digital media business unit focuses on the system on chip soc opportunities for the tv centric digital appliance market including internet ready digital tvs and digital set top boxes its immediate revenue ramp will come from the company s single chip digital television video processor dptv entering production during fiscal year 2001 the digital media business unit is under the management of dr jung herng chang as its president we believe that such a restructuring will permit us to rapidly grow our digital television product offerings and continue to expand our graphics chip markets by efficiently allocating resources between the two divisions however there is no assurance that this strategy will be successful on january 18 2000 our board of directors approved a spin off of our trident technology incorporated subsidiary and our trident multimedia technologies shanghai co ltd subsidiary it is our belief that these subsidiaries would operate more efficiently if their operations were managed as independent entities as of june 30 2000 we currently own a majority interest in both trident technology incorporated and trident multimedia technologies shanghai co ltd trident technology incorporated and trident multimedia technologies shanghai co ltd have total assets equal to 4 8 million and 3 9 million respectively it is our intention to spin off these subsidiaries after june 30 2000 however there are organizational operational and marketing factors that may delay the spin off of these subsidiaries and no assurance can be given that these subsidiaries will be profitable in the future liquidity and capital resources as of june 30 2000 our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of 39 million in fiscal year 2000 17 1 million of cash was provided by operations compared to fiscal 1999 in which 1 7 million of cash was used by operations cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to profitable operations and decreases in accounts receivable inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets offset by increases in accounts 21 page 22 payable accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred taxes capital expenditures in fiscal 2000 1999 and 1998 were 1 2 million 2 6 million and 3 8 million respectively in august 1995 we made an investment of 49 3 million in united integrated circuits corporation uicc on january 3 2000 united microelectronics corporation umc acquired uicc as a result of this merger and a 20 stock dividend payable to shareholders of record may 16 2000 we now own approximately 55 8 million shares of umc accordingly we reported a pretax gain of 117 million as other income in our statement of operations for the fiscal year 2000 the gain represents the difference between the cost of our previous investment in uicc and the quoted market price of the umc shares on the taiwan stock exchange as of the date that umc acquired uicc at such time as we choose to sell any umc shares our gain or loss on such portion of the investment will be revalued as of today a portion of the umc shares received by us as a result of the merger may now be sold at our discretion however in order to preserve the 12 5 wafer capacity guarantee of the uicc facility there are certain limitations on our ability to sell the shares during the march 2000 an investment in rise technology in the amount of 2 million was deemed unrecoverable by our management and written off therefore net gain on investments for fiscal 2000 equals approximately 115 million we believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months we regularly consider transactions to finance our activities including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions we believe our current reserves are adequate on april 13 2000 our board of directors approved an extension of the 20 million stock repurchase program originally approved in april 1998 for another twelve months starting from april 30 2000 to april 30 2001 during fiscal year 2000 680 000 shares of common stock were repurchased for 6 2 million under this plan during fiscal years 1999 and 1998 161 000 and 274 500 shares of common stock were repurchased for 0 9 million and 2 1 million under this plan respectively in october 1999 our board of directors authorized a one year budget of 20 0 million allowing our president and executive officers to make investments with no more than 3 0 million in any one company or technology investments can be made on terms and agreements as the officers consider appropriate within this authorization without further approval by the board the president of the company is to report at each board meeting on such activities at the end of fiscal year 2000 the cumulative purchases of investments totaled 8 1 million on april 13 2000 subject to the closing of the investment in trident described in the paragraph immediately below our board of directors approved an increase in the annual budget of investments to 50 0 million on february 10 2000 we entered into an agreement with umc affiliates unipac optoelectronics corp and hsun chieh investment co ltd to sell 1 057 828 shares of the company s common stock to unipac and 3 173 484 shares of the company s common stock to hsun chieh representing approximately 23 5 of the common stock that will be outstanding after the new issuance on april 13 2000 the trident board of directors approved an amendment to the existing agreement upon the request of these corporate investors under the terms of the amended agreement the company agreed to adjust the stock purchase price due to the recent stock market volatility aiming to continue the long term strategic relationship and further strengthen the company s cash position for future strategic expansion we expect that the proceeds of the stock purchase from the sale of the company s stock to unipac and hsun chieh will be approximately usd 42 million with a per share price equal to the five day average closing price of trident stock preceding april 17 2000 plus a ten percent premium on such average however we believe that the total aggregate consideration and the number of shares of our common stock sold pursuant to this transaction may be reduced to conform with applicable regulatory requirements closing of this transaction is contingent upon governmental and nasd regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions on april 19 2000 via technologies inc and trident microsystems inc announced that they have agreed to resolve all pending lawsuits both parties agreed to enter a settlement agreement in order to better focus on respective businesses and avoid the costs time and distractions of a lengthy legal process under the terms of the agreement trident will receive usd 10 17 million payable in two installments from via for a desktop software driver license fee contingent on the dismissal of all pending lawsuits in us and taiwan which is not in complete 22 page 23 control of trident and via the first installment of 6 17 million will be paid seven days after the dismissal of the lawsuit and the taiwan action the second installment of 4 0 million will be paid ninety days after the first installment on june 30 2000 we also reached an agreement with via and released the blade 3d source code which generated royalty and license revenue of 5 million in our fiscal 2000 statement of operations and we have also agreed to a new joint chip development with via ",

         "item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands results of operations general adelphia communications corporation adelphia or the company earned substantially all of its revenues in each of the last three fiscal years from monthly subscriber fees for basic satellite premium and ancillary services such as installations and equipment rentals local and national advertising sales pay per view programming home shopping networks and competitive access telecommunications services certain changes in the way the company offers and charges for subscriber services were implemented as of september 1 1993 under the 1992 cable act and under the company s revised method of offering certain services see regulatory and competitive matters below the high level of depreciation and amortization associated with the significant number of acquisitions in recent years the recent upgrading and expansion of systems and interest costs associated with financing activities will continue to have a negative impact on the reported results of operations also significant charges for depreciation amortization and interest are expected to be incurred in the future by the olympus joint venture which will also adversely impact adelphia s future results of operations adelphia expects to report net losses for the next several years the company currently offers competitive access telecommunications services through a subsidiary hyperion telecommunications inc hyperion since hyperion s formation in october 1992 it has formed operating companies or entered into joint venture partnerships to develop and operate competitive access networks in twelve select metropolitan areas the investment in hyperion has resulted in a reduction in the company s operating income before depreciation and amortization for fiscal years 1993 1994 and 1995 of 900 1 459 and 1 837 respectively included in these amounts are the equity in net loss of hyperion s joint venture partnerships which amounted to 0 387 and 963 for the fiscal years 1993 1994 and 1995 respectively the following table is derived from adelphia communications corporation consolidated financial statements for the years presented that are included in this annual report on form 10 k and sets forth the historical percentage relationship of the components of operating income contained in such financial statements for the years indicated percentage of revenues for year ended march 31 1993 1994 1995 revenues 100 0 100 0 100 0 operating expenses direct operating and programming 27 0 28 4 29 6 selling general and administrative 16 2 16 5 17 6 operating income before depreciation and amortization 56 8 55 1 52 8 depreciation and amortization 29 6 28 0 27 0 operating income 27 2 27 1 25 8 comparison of the years march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 revenues revenues increased approximately 4 5 for the year ended march 31 1994 compared with fiscal 1993 the majority of the increase was attributable to basic subscriber growth and rate increases with the remainder primarily attributable to the expansion of advertising sales and services revenues increased approximately 13 3 for the year ended march 31 1995 compared with fiscal 1994 the increase was attributable to the following acquisitions 87 basic subscriber growth 10 rate increases 0 advertising sales and other services 3 100 revenues for the year ended march 31 1994 and 1995 fully reflected the repackaging and adjustment of equipment and installation charges effective in july 1993 and rates for basic services and certain other satellite programming services under cableselect the company s method of offering services that was implemented effective september 1 1993 in addition fiscal 1994 and 1995 revenues were subject to the fcc rate freeze increases in total revenues for fiscal year 1994 are partially offset by a lower premium penetration rate which caused premium service revenues to remain relatively constant compared to the respective prior year direct operating and programming expenses direct operating and programming expenses which are mainly basic and premium programming costs and technical expenses increased 9 9 for the year ended march 31 1994 compared with the prior year primarily due to increased costs of providing programming to subscribers and incremental costs associated with increased subscribers and revenues direct operating and programming expenses increased 18 2 for the year ended march 31 1995 compared with fiscal 1994 primarily due to the increased operating expenses from acquired systems increased programming costs and incremental costs associated with increased subscribers selling general and administrative expenses these expenses which are mainly comprised of costs related to system offices customer service representatives and sales and administrative employees increased 6 7 and 20 2 the years ended march 31 1994 and 1995 respectively compared with the respective prior years the increases were primarily due to incremental costs associated with acquisitions subscriber growth and implementation of the 1992 cable act and regulations thereunder as a percentage of revenues such expenses remained relatively constant for fiscal 1994 compared with the prior year selling general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues for fiscal 1995 as compared with fiscal 1994 primarily due to wage and benefit increases without a corresponding increase in revenues as a result of the rate freeze enacted by the 1992 cable act operating income before depreciation and amortization operating income before depreciation and amortization was 173 377 175 697 and 191 025 for the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 respectively representing operating margins of 56 8 55 1 and 52 8 respectively the increases in operating income before depreciation and amortization for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1995 were due primarily to the impact of acquisitions offset by cost increases at a rate greater than increases in revenue due largely to the above noted rate freeze depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was higher for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1995 compared with the respective prior year primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions consummated during fiscal 1994 and 1995 and capital expenditures made during fiscal 1993 and 1994 priority investment income priority investment income is comprised of payments received from olympus of accrued priority return on the company s investment in plp interests in olympus the company recognizes priority investment income only to the extent received priority investment income remained unchanged for the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 ebitda ebitda earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization equity in net loss of joint ventures other non cash charges extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle amounted to 202 340 207 936 and 225 890 for the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 respectively the increase of 2 8 for the year ended march 31 1994 compared with fiscal 1993 is primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses the increase of 8 6 for the year ended march 31 1995 compared with fiscal 1994 is primarily due to the acquisition of cable systems during fiscal 1995 increased revenues and operating expenses during fiscal 1995 compared with the prior year primarily reflect the impact of acquisitions consummated during fiscal 1995 while ebitda is not an alternative to operating income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles the company s management believes ebitda is a meaningful measure of performance as substantially all of the company s financing agreements contain financial covenants based on ebitda interest expense interest expense increased approximately 10 5 and 7 4 for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1995 respectively compared with the respective prior year approximately 56 of the increase for fiscal 1995 was due to additional interest cost associated with incremental debt related to acquisitions interest expense increased during fiscal 1994 compared with the prior year due primarily to higher levels of debt outstanding and the refinancing of short term floating rate debt with long term fixed rate debt during fiscal 1993 and 1994 in the 18 months ending march 31 1994 the company issued debt securities in four separate transactions see financing activities each issue of these securities requires repayment of principal at maturity the earliest of which is in july 2000 the interest rate on these securities ranged from 9 1 2 to 11 7 8 some of the proceeds from the securities were used to repay bank debt which had weighted average interest rates of 6 36 and 6 35 at march 31 1993 and 1994 respectively interest expense includes 164 1 680 and 14 756 for the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 respectively of non cash accretion of original issue discount and non cash interest expense equity in loss of joint ventures the equity in loss of joint ventures represents primarily the company s pro rata share of olympus losses and the accretion requirements of olympus redeemable limited partner interests the decrease in fiscal 1994 compared with the prior year is primarily attributable to a decrease in the loss of olympus during such period as compared with fiscal 1993 which operations were adversely impacted by hurricane andrew the increase in fiscal 1995 compared with the prior year is primarily attributable to the impact of the sale by olympus of northeast and lower business interruption revenue net loss the company reported net losses of 176 795 187 860 and 106 284 for the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 respectively included in net loss for fiscal 1993 is the cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes by olympus of 59 500 and the extraordinary loss for the early extinguishment of debt of 14 386 net loss for fiscal 1994 included the cumulative effect of the change in accounting of income taxes by the company of 89 660 in addition to the effect of these items net loss decreased by 5 461 from fiscal 1993 to 1994 and increased by 8 836 for fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1995 the decrease in net loss in fiscal 1994 when compared with the prior year was due primarily to the significant decrease in the equity in net losses of joint ventures primarily olympus and higher operating income offset by higher interest expense the increase in net loss in fiscal 1995 when compared with fiscal 1994 was primarily due to an increase in the equity in net loss of joint venture primarily olympus and higher non cash interest expense partially offset by higher operating income liquidity and capital resources the cable television business is capital intensive and typically requires continual financing for the construction modernization maintenance expansion and acquisition of cable systems during the three fiscal years in the period ended march 31 1995 the company committed substantial capital resources for these purposes and for investments in olympus and other affiliates and entities these expenditures were funded through long term borrowings and to a lesser extent internally generated funds the company s ability to generate cash to meet its future needs will depend generally on its results of operations and the continued availability of external financing capital expenditures the company has developed an innovative fiber to feeder network architecture which is designed to increase channel capacity and minimize future capital expenditures while positioning the company to take advantage of future opportunities management believes its capital expenditures program has resulted in higher levels of channel capacity and addressability in comparison to other cable television operators capital expenditures for the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 were 70 975 75 894 and 92 082 respectively the increase in capital expenditures for fiscal 1993 1994 and 1995 compared to each prior year was primarily due to the acceleration of the rebuilding of plant using fiber to feeder technology and expenditures related to faster than expected growth of the company s competitive access telecommunications subsidiary hyperion telecommunications inc management expects capital expenditures for fiscal 1996 to be approximately equal to fiscal 1995 financing activities the company s financing strategy has been to maintain its public long term debt at the parent holding company level while the company s consolidated subsidiaries have their own senior and subordinated credit arrangements with banks and insurance companies the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet its future needs will depend generally on its results of operations and the continued availability of external financing during the three year period ended march 31 1995 the company funded its working capital requirements capital expenditures investments in olympus and other affiliates and entities and the redemption of the 16 5 senior discount notes and 13 senior subordinated notes through long term borrowings primarily from banks and insurance companies short term borrowings internally generated funds and the issuance of parent company public debt and equity the company generally has funded the principal and interest obligations on its long term borrowings from banks and insurance companies by refinancing the principal with new loans or through the issuance of parent company debt securities and by paying the interest out of internally generated funds adelphia has funded the interest obligations on its public borrowings from internally generated funds most of adelphia s directly owned

unaffiliated partnership during each of the years ended march 31 1993 1994 and 1995 the company received priority investment income from olympus of 22 300 on february 28 1995 olympus entered into a liquidation agreement with the gans family gans an olympus limited partner concurrently with the closing of the liquidation agreement acp holdings inc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and managing general partner of olympus certain shareholders of adelphia olympus and various telesat entities telesat wholly owned subsidiaries of florida power and light company fpl entered into an investment agreement whereby telesat contributed to olympus substantially all of the assets associated with certain cable television systems serving approximately 50 000 subscribers in southern florida in exchange for general and limited partner interests and newly issued preferred limited partner interests plp interests in olympus at that time adelphia converted certain amounts owed the company by olympus for advances plp interests and unpaid priority return on the plp interests to capital contributions this transaction net of advances made to olympus during the year ended march 31 1995 resulted in a net reduction of the amount due from olympus for advances of 25 307 after this transaction adelphia s ownership in olympus is 50 voting interest with fpl as its only other partner in olympus managed partnerships on september 29 1993 the board of directors of the company authorized the company to make loans in the future to highland video associates l p highland and syracuse hilton head holdings l p shhh up to an amount of 25 000 for each during the years ended march 31 1994 and 1995 the company made advances in the net amount of 7 828 and 10 028 respectively to these and other related parties primarily for capital expenditures and working capital purposes on october 6 1993 adelphia purchased the 14 preferred class b limited partnership interest in shhh for 18 338 from robin media group an unrelated party shhh is a joint venture of the rigas family and tele communications inc whose interests in shhh are junior to adelphia s during the year ended march 31 1994 the company made loans in the net amount of 15 000 to shhh to facilitate the acquisition of cable television systems serving palm beach county florida from unrelated parties during fiscal 1995 the company sold its investment in tmip to shhh for 13 000 on january 31 1995 a wholly owned subsidiary of adelphia received a 20 000 preferred investment from shhh to facilitate the acquisition of cable properties from tele media of delaware resources the company plans to continue to explore and consider new commitments arrangements or transactions to refinance existing debt increase the company s liquidity or decrease the company s leverage these could include among other things the future issuance by adelphia of public or private equity or debt and the negotiation of new or amended credit facilities these could also include entering into acquisitions joint ventures or other investment or financing activities although no assurance can be given that any such transactions will be consummated the company s ability to borrow under current credit facilities and to enter into refinancings and new financings is limited by covenants contained in adelphia s indentures and its subsidiaries credit agreements including covenants under which the ability to incur indebtedness is in part a function of applicable ratios of total debt to cash flow during the year ended march 31 1995 the increase in capital expenditures and accounts payable was primarily attributed to the companies acquired and an increase in the level of expenditures for new technology and rebuild activity the increase in accrued interest and other liabilities resulted from the timing of the payment of interest due on the company s indebtedness deferred taxes increased as of march 31 1995 compared with the balance as of march 31 1994 primarily due to the impact of acquired companies the company believes that cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds borrowings under existing credit facilities and future financing sources will be sufficient to meet its short term and long term liquidity and capital requirements although in the past the company has been able to refinance its indebtedness or obtain new financing there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future or that the terms of such financings would be favorable management believes that the telecommunications industry including the cable television and telephone industries is in a period of consolidation characterized by mergers joint ventures acquisitions sales of all or part of cable companies or their assets and other partnering and investment transactions of various structures and sizes involving cable or other telecommunications companies the company continues to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of its business through the acquisition of additional cable television systems in geographic proximity to its existing regional markets or in locations that can serve as a basis for new market areas the company like other cable television companies has participated from time to time and is participating in preliminary discussions with third parties regarding a variety of potential transactions and the company has considered and expects to continue to consider and explore potential transactions of various types with other cable and telecommunications companies however except as otherwise stated herein the company has not reached any agreements in principal or otherwise with respect to any material transaction and no assurances can be given as to whether any such transaction may be consummated or if so when recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes effective january 1 1993 and april 1 1993 respectively olympus and the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 109 the adoption of sfas no 109 resulted in the cumulative recognition of an additional liability by olympus and the company of 59 500 and 89 660 respectively sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of establishes accounting standards for assessing the impairment of long lived assets certain identifiable intangibles and

121 the adoption of sfas no 121 did not materially affect the financial statements of olympus or the company inflation in the three fiscal years ended march 31 1995 inflation did not have a significant effect on the company periods of high inflation could have an adverse effect to the extent that increased borrowing costs for floating rate debt may not be offset by increases in subscriber rates at march 31 1995 after giving effect to interest rate hedging agreements approximately 484 250 of the company s total debt was subject to floating interest rates olympus the company serves as the managing general partner of olympus and as of december 31 1994 held 10 000 of voting general partnership interests representing in the aggregate 50 of the voting interests of olympus the company also held as of december 31 1994 276 101 aggregate principal amount of nonvoting plp interests in olympus which entitle the company to a 16 5 per annum priority return and nonvoting special limited partnership interests the remaining equity in olympus consists of voting limited partnership interests held by unaffiliated third parties at december 31 1992 these interests included 10 000 of

prior year total revenues for the year ended december 31 1994 declined 4 2 from the prior year the 1993 increase in revenues as compared with 1992 was primarily attributable to basic subscriber growth and rate increases which were partially offset by the effects of hurricane andrew on the south dade system net of business interruption insurance proceeds see note 3 to the olympus communications l p consolidated financial statements the 1994 decrease as compared with 1993 was due to the sale of northeast in june 1994 partially offset by the positive impact of the south dade rebuild from the effects of hurricane andrew and subscriber growth operating income before depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 1993 operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 16 7 as compared with the prior year this increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of total revenues including business interruption revenue related to the effects of hurricane andrew that were not offset by corresponding increases in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 1994 operating income before depreciation and amortization decreased 14 7 as compared with the prior year the decrease was due to increased operating costs with no corresponding increase in rates due to the fcc rate freeze the impact of the sale of northeast and the decline in business interruption insurance revenue operating income for the year ended december 31 1993 operating income increased by 10 082 to 17 955 this increase was primarily due to the increase in total revenues including business interruption revenue and relatively constant depreciation and amortization and operating expenses for the year ended december 31 1994 operating income decreased by 7 579 to 10 376 the decrease was due to reduced business interruption insurance revenue in the current year the above noted fcc rate freeze impact and the effect of the northeast sale interest expense for the year ended december 31 1993 interest expense decreased 2 6 primarily due to reduced interest rates for the year ended december 31 1994 interest expense increased 9 5 primarily due to higher average rates outstanding on debt offset somewhat by the reduction of debt from the sale of northeast net loss olympus reported net losses of 16 617 70 744 and 21 025 for the years ended december 31 1992 1993 and 1994 respectively the increase in 1993 was mainly due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of 59 500 resulting from the adoption of sfas no 109 by olympus partially offset by increased operating income the decrease in net loss in 1994 was attributable to the absence in 1994 of the impact of the change in accounting for income taxes offset by lower operating income for the period regulatory and competitive matters the cable television operations of the company may be adversely affected by changes and developments in governmental regulation competitive forces and technology the cable television industry and the company are subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proceedings or proposals on october 5 1992 congress passed the 1992 cable act which significantly expands the scope of regulation of certain subscriber rates and a number of other matters in the cable industry such as mandatory carriage of local broadcast stations and retransmission consent and which will increase the administrative costs of complying with such regulations the fcc has adopted rate regulations that establish on a system by system basis maximum allowable rates for i basic and cable programming services other than programming offered on a per channel or per program basis based upon a benchmark methodology and ii associated equipment and installation services based upon cost plus a reasonable profit under the fcc rules franchising authorities are authorized to regulate rates for basic services and associated equipment and installation services and the fcc will regulate rates for regulated cable programming services in response to complaints filed with the agency the original rate regulations became effective on september 1 1993 amendments to the rate regulations became effective may 15 1994 further amendments were adopted on november 10 1994 the fcc ordered an interim rate freeze effective april 5 1993 which was extended through may 15 1994 the original rate regulations required a reduction of existing rates charged for basic services and regulated cable programming services to the greater of i the applicable benchmark level or ii the rates in force as of september 30 1992 reduced by 10 adjusted forward for inflation the amended regulations generally require a reduction of up to 17 percent from the rates for regulated services in force as of september 30 1992 adjusted forward for inflation and certain other factors rate reductions are not required to the extent that a cable operator at its option elects to use an alternative cost of service methodology and shows that rates for basic and cable programming services are reasonable the fcc has adopted interim rules to govern cost of service showings by cable operators refunds with interest will be required to be paid by cable operators who are required to reduce regulated rates after september 1 1993 calculated retroactively from the date of a local franchising authority s decision with regard to basic rates and from the date a complaint is filed with the fcc with regard to the rates charged for regulated programming services the fcc has reserved the right to reduce or increase the benchmarks it has established the rate regulations will also limit future increases in regulated rates to an inflation indexed amount plus increases in certain costs such as taxes franchise fees costs associated with specific franchise requirements and increased programming costs cost based adjustments to these capped rates can also be made in the event a cable operator adds or deletes channels on november 10 1994 the fcc adopted an alternative method for adjusting the rates charged for a cable programming services tier when new services are added this will allow cable operators to increase rates by as much as 1 50 over a two year period to reflect the addition of up to six new channels of service on cable programming service tiers in addition a new programming tier can be created the rate for which would not be regulated as long as certain conditions are met such as not moving services from existing tiers to the new one because of the limitation on rate increases for regulated services future revenue growth from cable services will rely to a much greater extent than has been true in the past on increased revenues from unregulated services and new subscribers than from increases in previously unregulated rates the fcc has adopted regulations implementing virtually all of the requirements of the 1992 cable act as noted above amendments to the rate regulations were recently announced and the fcc is also likely to continue to modify clarify or refine the rate regulations in addition litigation has been instituted challenging various portions of the 1992 cable act and the rulemaking proceedings including the rate regulations the company cannot predict the effect or outcome of future rulemaking proceedings changes to the rate regulations or litigation further because the fcc has only issued its interim rules and has not adopted final cost of service rules the company has not determined to what extent it will be able to utilize cost of service showings to justify rates effective as of september 1 1993 in accordance with the 1992 cable act the company adjusted the basic service rates and related equipment and installation rates in all of its systems in order for such rates to be in compliance with the applicable benchmark or equipment and installation cost levels the company also implemented a program in all of its systems called cableselect under which most of the company s satellite delivered programming services are now offered individually on a per channel basis or as a group at a price of approximately 15 to 20 below the sum of the per channel prices of all such services for subscribers who elect to customize their channel lineup the company will provide for a monthly rental fee an electronic device located on the cable line outside the home enabling a subscriber s television to receive only those channels selected by the subscriber these basic service rate adjustments and the cableselect program have also been implemented in all systems managed by the company the company believes cableselect provides increased programming choices to the company s subscribers while providing flexibility to the company to respond to future changes in areas such as customer demand and programming a letter of inquiry one of at least 63 sent by the fcc to numerous cable operators was received by an olympus system regarding the implementation of this new method of offering services olympus responded in writing to the fcc s inquiry on november 18 1994 the cable services bureau of the fcc issued a decision holding that the cableselect program was an evasion of the rate regulations and ordered this package to be treated as a regulated tier this decision and all other letter of inquiry decisions were principally decided on the number of programming services moved from regulated tiers to a la carte packages adelphia has appealed this decision to the full commission the company cannot predict the outcome or effect of this proceeding on november 10 1994 the fcc ruled that prospectively any a la carte package will be treated as a regulated tier except for packages involving premium services the company is currently unable to predict the effect that the amended regulations future fcc treatment of a la carte packages or other future fcc rulemaking proceedings will have on its business and results of operations in future periods no assurance can be given at this time that such matters will not have a material negative financial impact on the company s business and results of operations in the future also no assurance can be given as to what other future actions congress the fcc or other regulatory authorities may take or the effects thereof on the company cable television companies operate under franchises granted by local authorities which are subject to renewal and renegotiation from time to time because such franchises are generally non exclusive there is a potential for competition with the systems from other operators of cable television systems including public systems operated by municipal franchising authorities themselves and from other distribution systems capable of delivering television programming to homes the 1992 cable act contains provisions which encourage competition from such other sources additionally recent court and administrative decisions have removed certain of the restrictions that have limited entry into the cable television business by potential competitors such as telephone companies and proposals now under consideration by the fcc and which are being and from time to time have been considered by congress could result in the elimination of other such restrictions the company cannot predict the extent to which competition will materialize from other cable television operators other distribution systems for delivering television programming to the home or other potential competitors or if such competition materializes the extent of its effect on the company fcc rules permit local telephone companies to offer video dialtone service for video programmers including channel capacity for the carriage of video programming and certain non common carrier activities such as video processing billing and collection and joint marketing agreements on december 15 1992 new jersey bell telephone company filed an application with the fcc to operate a video dialtone service in portions of dover county new jersey in which the company serves approximately 20 000 subscribers the fcc approved the application on july 18 1994 the company has appealed this decision to the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia this case is presently pending a number of telephone companies have filed suit seeking to void as unconstitutional the provisions in the 1984 cable act that prohibit telephone companies from owning cable television systems in their telephone service areas the u s courts of appeal for the fourth and ninth circuits have struck down the cross ownership ban on first amendment grounds several federal district courts have also struck down the cross ownership ban on the same grounds in addition legislation which would alter or eliminate the cross ownership ban is under active consideration in congress direct broadcast satellite dbs service became available to consumers during 1994 a single dbs satellite can provide more than 100 channels of programming dbs service can be received virtually anywhere in the united states through the installation of a small outdoor antenna dbs service is being heavily marketed on a nation wide basis the extent to which dbs will be competitive with cable systems will depend on the continued availability of reception equipment and programming at reasonable prices to the consumer the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the video dialtone proceeding or the cross ownership ban litigation however the company believes that the provision of video programming by telephone companies in competition with the company s existing operations could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations at this time the impact of any such effect is not known or estimable see item

regulated tiers and cable operators engaging in such practices may be subject to fines and or further rate adjustments the company is examining its a la carte packages and may modify certain packages in light of these guidelines the company is currently unable to predict the effect that the amended regulations future fcc treatment of a la carte packages or other future fcc rulemaking proceedings will have on its business and results of operations in future periods no assurance can be given at this time that such matters will not have a material negative financial impact on the company s business and results of operations in the future also no assurance can be given as to what other future actions congress the fcc or other regulatory authorities may take or the effects thereof on the company cable television companies operate under franchises granted by local authorities which are subject to renewal and renegotiation from time to time because such franchises are generally non exclusive there is a potential for competition with the systems from other operators of cable television systems including public systems operated by municipal franchising authorities themselves and from other distribution systems capable of delivering television programming to homes the 1992 cable act contains provisions which encourage competition from such other sources additionally recent court and administrative decisions have removed certain of the restrictions that have limited entry into the cable television business by potential competitors such as telephone companies and proposals now under consideration by the fcc and which are being and from time to time have been considered by congress could result in the elimination of other such restrictions the company cannot predict the extent to which competition will materialize from other cable television operators other distribution systems for delivering television programming to the home or other potential competitors or if such competition materializes the extent of its effect on the company fcc rules permit local telephone companies to offer video dialtone service for video programmers including channel capacity for the carriage of video programming and certain non common carrier activities such as video processing billing and collection and joint marketing agreements on december 15 1992 new jersey bell telephone company filed an application with the fcc to operate a video dialtone service in portions of dover county new jersey in which the company serves approximately 20 000 subscribers the company opposed the application on july 28 1993 the fcc sent a letter to new jersey bell stating that the application appeared to be inconsistent with the fcc s video dialtone requirements in that insufficient capacity to serve multiple programmers was to be made available new jersey bell was given the opportunity to amend its application which it subsequently did the company then filed a further opposition to the application the matter has not yet been decided by the fcc on december 17 1992 the chesapeake and potomac telephone company of virginia and bell atlantic video service company bell atlantic video filed suit in u s district court in alexandria virginia seeking to declare unconstitutional the provisions in the 1984 cable act that prohibit telephone companies from owning cable television systems in their telephone service areas on august 24 1993 the court held that the 1984 cable act cross ownership provision is unconstitutional and it issued an order enjoining the fcc from enforcing the cross ownership ban the u s justice department has appealed this decision to the u s court of appeals for the fourth circuit similar suits have been filed in other federal district courts on june 15 1994 the united states district court for the western district court of washington also struck down the cross ownership ban on first amendment grounds in addition legislation which would alter or eliminate the cross ownership ban is under active consideration in congress the company cannot predict the outcome of the new jersey bell video dialtone proceeding or the cross ownership ban litigation however the company believes that the provision of video programming by telephone companies with considerable financial resources in competition with the company s existing operations could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations at this time the magnitude of any such effect is not known or estimable for further discussion of regulatory and competitive matters see business competition and legislation and regulation results of operations general the company earned substantially all of its revenues in each of the past three fiscal years from monthly subscriber fees for basic satellite premium and ancillary services such as installations and equipment rentals local and national advertising sales pay per view programming and home shopping networks the company has achieved average annual growth in revenues of 8 3 during the past two fiscal years and average annual growth in operating income before depreciation and amortization of 6 9 during the same period revenues increased 4 5 in fiscal 1994 and 11 5 in fiscal 1993 these increases resulted primarily from internal subscriber growth and rate increases the company has not completed any material acquisitions since august 1989 operating expenses increased significantly during the past two years however operating margins the percentage representing operating income before depreciation and amortization divided by revenues remained relatively unchanged at 55 1 for the year ended march 31 1994 56 8 for the year ended march 31 1993 and 56 4 for the year ended march 31 1992 the high level of i depreciation and amortization associated with prior acquisitions and the upgrading and expansion of systems and ii interest costs associated with financing activities will continue to have a negative impact on the reported results of operations significant charges for depreciation amortization and interest are expected to be incurred in the future by the olympus joint venture which will also impact the company s future results of operations the company expects to report net losses for the next several years the company currently offers competitive access telecommunications services through a subsidiary hyperion telecommunications inc hyperion since hyperion s formation in october 1992 it has formed operating companies or entered into joint venture partnerships to develop and operate competitive access networks in eight metropolitan areas hyperion s revenues since inception are insignificant and correspondingly the investment in hyperion resulted in a reduction in the company s operating income before depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 1994 and 1993 of approximately 1 459 000 and 900 000 respectively the equity in net loss of hyperion s joint venture partnerships amounted to 386 870 for the period from inception through march 31 1994 the following table is derived from the adelphia communications corporation consolidated financial statements for the periods presented that are included in this form 10 k and sets forth the historical percentage relationship of the components of operating income contained in such financial statements for the periods indicated percentage of revenues for year ended march 31 1994 1993 1992 revenues 100 0 100 0 100 0 operating expenses direct operating and pro

increase for fiscal 1994 and 90 of such increase for fiscal 1993 were attributable to basic subscriber growth and rate increases with the remainder primarily attributable to the expansion of advertising sales and other services revenues for fiscal 1994 reflect the repackaging and adjustment of equipment and installation charges in july 1993 and rates for basic services and certain other satellite programming services under cableselect effective september 1 1993 in addition fiscal 1994 revenues were subject to the fcc rate freeze increases in total revenues were partially offset by a lower premium penetration rate which caused premium service revenues to remain relatively constant compared to the respective prior year direct operating and programming expenses direct operating and programming expenses which are mainly basic and premium programming costs and technical expenses increased in each of the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 primarily due to increased costs of providing programming to subscribers and incremental costs associated with increased subscribers and revenues selling general and administrative expenses these expenses which are mainly comprised of costs related to system offices customer service representatives and sales and administrative employees increased in each of the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 the increases were primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased subscribers and revenues and for fiscal 1994 increased costs related to the implementation of the 1992 cable act and regulations thereunder as a percentage of revenues such expenses remained relatively constant for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 compared to the prior years operating income before depreciation and amortization operating income before depreciation and amortization was 175 697 000 173 377 000 and 154 416 000 for the years ended march 31 1994 1993 and 1992 respectively representing operating margins of 55 1 56 8 and 56 4 respectively the increases in operating income before depreciation and amortization for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 were primarily attributable to increased revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses this increase was also offset by the company s investment through hyperion in the competitive access business which resulted in an approximately 1 459 000 and 900 000 reduction in operating income before depreciation and amortization for fiscal 1994 and 1993 respectively depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was higher for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 compared to fiscal 1992 primarily due to capital expenditures made during fiscal 1994 and 1993 as a percentage of revenues such expenses decreased for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 compared to each respective prior year primarily due to increased revenues priority investment income priority investment income is comprised of payments received from olympus of accrued priority return on the company s investment in plp interests in olympus the company recognizes priority investment income only to the extent received priority investment income remained constant for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 compared to the prior years ebitda ebitda amounted to 207 936 000 202 340 000 and 180 769 000 for the years ended march 31 1994 1993 and 1992 respectively the increases in ebitda for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 were primarily attributable to increased revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses ebitda and similar measures of cash flow are commonly used in the cable television industry to analyze and compare cable television companies on the basis of operating performance leverage and liquidity interest expense interest expense increased during fiscal 1994 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher levels of debt outstanding and the refinancing of short term floating rate debt with long term fixed rate debt during fiscal 1993 and 1994 interest expense remained relatively constant for the year ended march 31 1993 primarily as a result of a reduction in the weighted average interest rate paid to banks since march 31 1992 offset by increased interest expense on incremental borrowings interest expense includes 1 680 000 164 000 and 35 602 000 for the years ended march 31 1994 1993 and 1992 respectively of non cash accretion of original issue discount and noncash interest expense equity in net loss of olympus the equity in net loss of olympus represents the company s pro rata share of olympus net losses and the accretion requirements of olympus redeemable limited partner interests the decrease in equity in net loss of olympus prior to the cumulative effect of its change in accounting principle for the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 compared to the prior years is primarily attributable to a decrease in the net loss of olympus during such period net loss the company reported net losses of 187 860 000 176 795 000 and 121 605 000 for the years ended march 31 1994 1993 and 1992 respectively the company reported loss before income tax extraordinary loss and

1994 and 1993 was primarily due to an increase in revenues in 1993 the increase in net loss was primarily due to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle by olympus and to the extraordinary loss recorded in 1993 for the early extinguishment of debt the increase in net loss for fiscal 1994 was primarily due to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for the company see recent accounting pronouncements below effective january 1 1993 and april 1 1993 olympus and the company respectively adopted the provisions of sfas 109 which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes sfas 109 resulted in the cumulative recognition of an additional liability of 59 500 000 and 89 660 000 by olympus and the company respectively liquidity and capital resources the cable television business is capital intensive and typically requires continual financing for the construction modernization maintenance expansion and acquisition of cable systems during the three fiscal years in the period ended march 31 1994 the company committed substantial capital resources for these purposes and for investments in olympus and other affiliates and entities these expenditures were funded through long term borrowings and to a lesser extent internally generated funds the company s ability to generate cash to meet its future needs will depend generally on its results of operations and the continued availability of external financing capital expenditures the company has developed an innovative fiber to feeder network architecture which is designed to increase channel capacity and minimize future capital expenditures while positioning the company to take advantage of future opportunities management believes its capital expenditures program has resulted in higher levels of channel capacity and addressability in comparison to other cable television operators capital expenditures for the years ended march 31 1994 1993 and 1992 were 75 894 000 70 975 000 and 52 808 000 respectively an additional 7 186 000 and 8 742 000 in support equipment was acquired and financed through capitalized lease obligations during the years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 respectively the increase in capital expenditures for fiscal 1994 and 1993 compared to each prior year was primarily due to the acceleration of the rebuilding of plant using fiber to feeder technology the upgrading of the corporate computer system for better management information services the purchase of support equipment renovation costs related to the corporate office building and expenditures related to faster than expected growth of the company s competitive access tele communications subsidiary hyperion telecommunications inc

olympus and during the fiscal years ended march 31 1994 and 1993 the company made advances of 16 554 000 and 49 061 000 respectively to olympus such investments provided funds for capital expenditures

income from olympus of 22 300 000 22 300 000 and 22 300 000 respectively future investments by the company in olympus are subject to certain limitations under the indentures for the company s parent company public debt financing activities the company s financing strategy has been to maintain its public long term debt at the parent holding company level while the company s consolidated subsidiaries have their own senior and subordinated credit arrangements with banks and insurance companies the company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet its future needs will depend generally on its results of operations and the continued availability of external financing during the three year period ended march 31 1994 the company funded its working capital requirements capital expenditures investments in olympus and other affiliates and entities and the redemption of the 16 5 senior discount notes and 13 senior subordinated notes through long term borrowings primarily from banks and insurance companies short term borrowings internally generated funds and the issuance of parent company public debt and equity the company generally has funded the principal and interest obligations on its long term borrowings from banks and insurance companies by refinancing the principal with new loans or through the issuance of parent company debt securities and by paying the interest out of internally generated funds adelphia has funded the interest obligations on its public borrowings from internally generated funds most of adelphia s directly owned subsidiaries have

explore and consider new commitments arrangements or transactions to refinance existing debt increase the company s liquidity or decrease the company s leverage these could include among other things the future issuance by adelphia of public or private equity or debt and the negotiation of new or amended credit facilities these could also include entering into acquisitions joint ventures or other investment or financing activities although no assurance can be given that any such transactions will be consummated the company s ability to borrow under current credit facilities and to enter into refinancings and new financings is limited by covenants contained in adelphia s indentures and its subsidiaries credit agreements including covenants under which the ability to incur indebtedness is in part a function of applicable ratios of total debt to cash flow the company believes that cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds borrowings under existing credit facilities and future financing sources will be sufficient to meet its short term and long term liquidity and capital requirements although in the past the company has been able to refinance its indebtedness or obtain new financing there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future or that the terms of such financings would be favorable management believes that the telecommunications industry including the cable television and telephone industries is in a period of consolidation characterized by mergers joint ventures acquisitions sales of all or part of cable companies or their assets and other partnering and investment transactions of various structures and sizes involving cable or other telecommunications companies the company continues to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of its business through the acquisition of additional cable television systems in geographic proximity to its existing regional markets or in locations that can serve as a basis for new market areas management also believes that the company is well positioned to participate in this consolidation trend due to its well clustered cable systems the quality of its cable plant its management strengths and its relationships within the cable industry the company like other cable television companies has participated from time to time and is participating in preliminary discussions with third parties regarding a variety of potential transactions and the company has considered and expects to continue to consider and explore potential transactions of various types with other cable and telecommunications companies however except as otherwise stated herein the company has not reached any agreements in principal or otherwise with respect to any material transaction and no assurances can be given as to whether any such transaction may be consummated or if so when recent accounting pronouncements sfas 109 accounting for income taxes requires an asset and liability

1 over the prior year the 1993 increase and the 1992 increase were primarily attributable to basic subscriber growth and rate increases which were partially offset by the effects of hurricane andrew on the south dade system net of business interruption insurance proceeds see note 3 to the olympus communications l p consolidated financial statements operating income before depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31 1993 and 1992 respectively operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 16 7 and 5 3 and the operating margin increased to 56 and 50 6 these increases were primarily attributable to higher levels of total revenues including business interruption revenue related to the effects of hurricane andrew that were not offset by corresponding increases in operating expenses operating income for the year ended december 31 1993 operating income increased to 17 955 000 from 7 873 000 operating income for the year ended december 31 1992 increased from 6 479 000 to 7 873 000 these increases were primarily due to the increase in total revenues including business interruption revenue and relatively constant depreciation and amortization and operating expenses interest expense for the year ended december 31 1993 interest expense decreased 2 7 primarily due to reduced interest rates for the year ended december 31 1992 interest expense decreased 23 2 primarily due to reduced interest rates and lower average amounts of outstanding debt net loss olympus reported net losses of 70 744 000 16 617 000 and 36 577 000 for the years ended december 31 1993 1992 and 1991 respectively the increase in 1993 was mainly due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 59 500 000 resulting from the adoption of sfas 109 by olympus partially offset by increased operating income the decrease in net loss in 1992 was attributable to increased revenues and reduced interest expense partially offset by increased operating

         "item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including the risks discussed in risk factors and elsewhere herein 12 page overview we develop and market products that transport voice and data traffic over wavelengths of light our products enable service providers to quickly and cost effectively provide bandwidth and create new high speed data services from our inception in february 1998 through may 1999 our operating activities consisted primarily of research and development product design development and testing during this period we also staffed and trained our administrative marketing and sales personnel and began sales and marketing activities we began shipping our sn 6000 intelligent optical transport product in may 1999 our sn 8000 intelligent optical node in august 1999 our silvxmanager network management system in november 1999 and our sn 16000 intelligent optical switch in june 2000 we achieved our first quarter of profitability in the quarter ended april 29 2000 as of july 31 2000 we had retained earnings of 216 000 in order to maintain profitability we will need to generate significantly higher revenue as we expect to continue to incur significant research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as our business and operations continue to grow our policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is deemed probable if uncertainties regarding customer acceptance exist revenue is recognized when the uncertainties are resolved revenue from technical support and maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements we record a warranty liability for parts and labor on our products at the time of revenue recognition warranty periods are generally three years from installation date our manufacturing expenses consist of amounts paid to third party manufacturers manufacturing personnel and related costs and our customer support group we outsource our manufacturing and assembly requirements accordingly a significant portion of our manufacturing expenses consists of payments to a third party contract manufacturer manufacturing and engineering documentation controls are performed at our facility in chelmsford massachusetts we believe that our gross margins will be affected primarily by the following factors demand for our products new product introductions both by us and by our competitors changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors the mix of product configurations sold and the volume of manufacturing and its effect on manufacturing and component costs research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs prototype costs and other costs related to the design development testing and enhancement of our products to date we have expensed our research and development costs as they were incurred several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses we incur significant expenses in connection with the purchase of testing equipment for our products we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and intend to enhance our technology to meet the changing requirements of our customers as a result we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and the related personnel costs of sales and marketing personnel commissions promotional travel and other marketing expenses and recruiting expenses we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we increase our direct sales efforts expand our operations both domestically and internationally hire additional sales and marketing personnel initiate additional marketing programs and establish sales offices in new locations general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive finance legal facilities human resources and information technology personnel recruiting expenses and professional fees we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business 13 page in connection with the granting of certain stock options and the issuance of certain restricted shares during the period from inception through july 31 1998 and the fiscal years ended july 31 1999 and 2000 with exercise or sales prices which were deemed to be below fair market value we recorded deferred stock compensation expense of approximately 184 000 25 2 million and 31 7 million respectively these amounts are being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the applicable options or restricted stock which are typically five years with 20 vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and 5 vesting quarterly thereafter sirocco acquisition on september 7 2000 we acquired sirocco systems inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests an aggregate of approximately 28 4 million shares of sycamore common stock were either exchanged for all outstanding shares of sirocco or reserved for common stock issuable under outstanding sirocco stock options assumed by us in the transaction results of operations fiscal years ended july 31 2000 and 1999 revenue revenue increased 186 8 million or 1 649 to 198 1 million for fiscal 2000 compared to 11 3 million for fiscal 1999 the increase in revenue is primarily due to increased sales of our products and the broadening of our product offerings including the sn8000 and sn16000 one customer accounted for 92 and 100 of our revenue for fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively cost of revenue cost of revenue increased 96 5 million to 105 0 million for fiscal 2000 compared to 8 5 million for fiscal 1999 the increase in cost of revenue is primarily related to increased revenue since we began shipping products in may 1999 as well as headcount increases in our manufacturing overhead and customer service organizations warranty and other period costs gross profit as a percentage of revenue were 47 and 25 for fiscal 2000 and 1999 respectively the increase in gross profit in fiscal 2000 to fiscal 1999 was largely attributable to higher volume of product shipments research and development expenses research and development expenses increased 40 6 million to 54 6 million for fiscal 2000 compared to 14 0 million for fiscal 1999 the increase in expenses was primarily due to increased costs associated with a significant increase in personnel and personnel related expenses increases in non recurring engineering costs and increases in prototype expenses for the design and development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products research and development is essential to our future success and we expect the dollar amounts of research and development expenses will increase in future periods to support the continued development of our intelligent optical transport and optical switching products as well as new or complementary technologies sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 26 0 million to 30 1 million for fiscal 2000 compared to 4 1 million for fiscal 1999 the increase in expenses reflect the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel sales based commissions additional office space both domestically and internationally and marketing program costs including web development trade shows and new product launch activities we intend to continue to expand our domestic and international sales force and marketing efforts and as a result expect that the dollar amounts of sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods 14 page general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 5 3 million to 6 7 million for fiscal 2000 compared to 1 4 million for fiscal 1999 the increase in expenses reflect the hiring of additional general and administrative personnel and expenses necessary to support increased levels of business activities we expect that the dollar amounts of general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as a result of expansion of business activity and related expenses to support sycmore s operations amortization of stock compensation amortization of stock compensation expense was 12 3 million for fiscal 2000 an increase of 8 8 million from 3 5 million for fiscal 1999 amounts for fiscal 2000 and 1999 include 1 4 million and 2 1 million of compensation expense associated with the grant of options to purchase common stock to non employees respectively amortization of stock compensation expense primarily resulted from the granting of stock options and restricted shares with exercise or sale prices which were deemed to be below fair market value amortization of stock compensation relating to these grants is expected to affect our reported results of operations through the first quarter of fiscal 2005 interest income net interest income net increased 40 6 million to 41 2 million for fiscal 2000 compared to 559 000 for fiscal 1999 the increase in interest income primarily reflects the earned income from the invested proceeds of our two public offerings within fiscal year 2000 provision for income taxes we provided for income taxes at 33 of income before income taxes during fiscal 2000 the provision for fiscal 2000 differed from the expected federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to non deductible stock compensation and the utilization of net operating carryforwards and tax credits during fiscal 2000 we reduced our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets by 6 6 million as the realization of such assets became probable we did not provide for income taxes in fiscal 1999 primarily due to the loss from operations and the uncertainty of the realization of deferred tax assets year ended july 31 1999 and the period from inception february 17 1998 through july 31 1998 fiscal 1998 revenue we began shipping the sn 6000 in may 1999 and recognized 11 3 million of revenue for the year ended july 31 1999 all revenue was derived from the shipments of the sn 6000 product for fiscal 1999 one customer accounted for all of our revenue cost of revenue cost of revenue was 8 5 million or 75 of revenue for the year ended july 31 1999 we began shipping the sn 6000 in may 1999 cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 1999 were high due to the high cost of initial start up of production including the increase in personnel and the low volume of sales research and development expenses research and development expenses were 14 0 million for fiscal 1999 and 497 000 for fiscal 1998 and represented 61 and 63 of total operating expenses for fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively the increase in expenses was primarily due to increased costs associated with a significant increase in personnel and personnel related expenses an increase in non recurring engineering costs and an increase in prototype expenses for the design and development of the sn 6000 sn 8000 and sn 16000 products 15 page sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were 4 1 million for fiscal 1999 and 92 000 for fiscal 1998 and represented 18 and 12 of total operating expenses in fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively the increase in expenses reflects the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel sales based commissions and marketing program costs including web development trade shows and product launch activities general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were 1 4 million for fiscal 1999 and 199 000 for fiscal 1998 and represented 6 and 25 of total operating expenses in fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively the increase in expenses reflects the hiring of additional general and administrative personnel and expenses necessary to support and scale our operations we intend to continue to expand our domestic and international sales force and marketing efforts and as a result expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods amortization of stock compensation amortization of stock compensation expense was 1 4 million and 5 000 for fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 respectively amortization of stock compensation expense in fiscal 1998 resulted from the granting of stock options and restricted shares with the exercise or sales prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant additionally in fiscal 1999 we incurred 2 1 million of compensation expense associated with the grant of options to non employees and members of our advisory boards interest income net interest income net was 559 000 and 100 000 for fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 respectively interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances and marketable securities and interest expense associated with our equipment note payable the increase in interest income reflects higher invested balances in fiscal 1999 offset by interest payments on our equipment note payable in fiscal 1999 liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering which we completed in october 1999 we financed our operations primarily through private sales of our capital stock totaling approximately 59 million and through borrowings on long term debt agreements for the purchase of capital equipment in fiscal 2000 we completed two public offerings for which we sold 30 9 million shares of common stock and generated net proceeds of approximately 1 5 billion we primarily invest excess funds in investment grade short term money market funds commercial paper government and non government marketable securities as of july 31 2000 we had 1 5 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash provided by operating activities was 52 8 million for fiscal 2000 compared to the cash used of 27 6 million and 0 6 million in fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 reflects net income and increased accrued expenses deferred revenue and accounts payable partially offset by increased inventory purchases and accounts receivable cash used in investing activities was 1 1 billion 10 0 million and 3 7 million for the years ended july 31 2000 1999 and fiscal 1998 respectively the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2000 reflects net investment of our public offerings proceeds into marketable securities and increased purchases of property and equipment primarily for computers and test equipment for our development and manufacturing activities cash provided by financing activities was 1 5 billion 58 4 million and 5 5 million for the years ended july 31 2000 1999 and fiscal 1998 respectively the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2000 is primarily due to net proceeds raised through our public offerings and the exercise of stock options 16 page increasingly as a result of the financial demands of major network deployments service providers are looking to their suppliers for financing assistance from time to time we may provide or commit to extend credit or credit support to our customers as we consider appropriate in the course of our business considering our limited resources this financing may include extending credit to customers or guaranteeing the indebtedness of customers to third parties depending upon market conditions we may seek to factor these arrangements to financial institutions and investors to free up our capital and reduce the amount of our commitments for such arrangements our ability to provide customer financing is limited and depends upon a number of factors including our capital structure and level of our available credit and our ability to factor commitments any extension of financing to our customers will limit the capital that we have available for other uses although we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame or that such additional funding if needed will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all year 2000 computer systems compliance to date the results of our year 2000 readiness plan indicate that our assessment improvement and testing program succeeded in providing us with a smooth transition to the year 2000 we have not experienced any significant year 2000 disruptions with our products our internal information technology systems or our major vendors based on our experience to date we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruption related to the year 2000 transition we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year 2000 to ensure that any latent year 2000 matters that may arise are addressed promptly recent accounting pronouncements in june 1998 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 133 this accounting standard which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at estimated fair value in june 2000 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 133 this accounting standard amended the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 133 for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities the adoption of sfas no 133 as amended is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in december 1999 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues the application of the guidance in sab 101 will be required in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 the effects of applying this guidance if any will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment resulting from a change in accounting principle the company does not believe that adoption of sab 101 will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations factors that may affect future results factors related to our business we expect that substantially all of our revenue will continue to be generated from a limited number of customers and our revenue will not grow if we do not successfully sell products to these customers 17 page we currently have a limited number of customers one of whom williams communications accounts for substantially all of our revenue to date williams is not contractually committed to purchase any minimum quantities of products from us we expect that in the foreseeable future substantially all of our revenue will continue to depend on sales of our intelligent optical networking products to williams and a limited number of current and prospective new customers the rate at which our current and prospective customers purchase products from us will depend in part on their success in selling communications services based on these products to their own customers and the rate at which these customers expend capital and deploy their network any failure of current or prospective customers to purchase products from us for any reason including any determination not to install our products in their networks downturn in capital expenditure or downturn in their business would seriously harm our financial condition or results of our operations our limited operating history makes forecasting difficult we were founded in february 1998 we shipped our sn 6000 intelligent optical transport product in may 1999 our sn 8000 intelligent optical node in august 1999 our silvxmanager network management system in november 1999 and our sn 16000 intelligent optical switch in june 2000 we have limited meaningful historical financial data from which to base projected revenues and planned operating expenses and upon which investors may evaluate us and our prospects in addition our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed you should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies like ours in a new and rapidly evolving market our ability to sell products and the level of success if any we achieve depends among other things on the level of demand for intelligent optical networking products which is a new and rapidly evolving market if we do not achieve our expected revenue our operating results will be below our expectations and the expectations of our investors and market analysts which could cause the price of our common stock to decline our failure to increase our revenue would prevent us from maintaining profitability we have a history of losses and in the quarter ended july 31 2000 we achieved profitability for the first time on an operating income basis we cannot assure you that our revenue will grow or that we will generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing sales and marketing product development administrative and other expenses although our revenue has grown in recent quarters we cannot be certain that our revenue growth will continue or increase in the future or that we will realize sufficient revenue to sustain profitability on an annual or quarterly basis we are entirely dependent on our line of intelligent optical networking products and our future revenue depends on their commercial success our future growth depends on the commercial success of our line of intelligent optical networking products to date our sn 6000 intelligent optical transport product sn 8000 intelligent optical network node silvx manager network management system and sn 16000 intelligent optical switch are the only products that have been shipped to customers we intend to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to existing products in the future we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing the development or introduction of these products failure of our current or planned products to operate as expected could delay or prevent their adoption if our target customers do not adopt purchase and successfully deploy our current and planned products our revenue will not grow significantly because our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that we find only after full deployment which could seriously harm our business our intelligent optical networking products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large and complex networks because of the nature of the products they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in very large networks with high amounts of traffic our customers may discover errors or defects in 18 page the hardware or the software or the product may not operate as expected after it has been fully deployed if we are unable to fix errors or other problems that may be identified in full deployment we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share loss of customers failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources increased service and warranty costs legal actions by our customers and increased insurance costs the long and variable sales cycles for our products may cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter a customer s decision to purchase our intelligent optical networking products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation testing and product qualification process as a result our sales cycle is typically lengthy throughout the sales cycle we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the use and features of our products even after making a decision to purchase we believe that our customers will deploy the products slowly and deliberately timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skills of the customer the size of the network deployment the complexity of the customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary customers with complex networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis accordingly we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis because of our limited operating history and the nature of our business we cannot predict these sales and deployment cycles the long sales cycles as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause our revenue and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter we may not be successful if our customer base does not grow our future success will depend on our attracting additional customers the growth of our customer base could be adversely affected by customer unwillingness to implement our new optical networking architecture customer ability to devote capital to build their networks any delays or difficulties that we may incur in completing the development and introduction of our planned products or product enhancements new product introductions by our competitors any failure of our products to perform as expected or any difficulty we may incur in meeting customers delivery requirements the intelligent optical networking market is new and our business will suffer if it does not develop as we expect the market for intelligent optical networking products is new we cannot assure you that a viable market for our products will develop or be sustainable if this market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition would be seriously harmed 19 page if we do not respond rapidly to technological changes our products could become obsolete the market for intelligent optical networking products is likely to continue to be characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments we may experience design manufacturing marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements the introduction of new products by competitors market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete in developing our products we have made and will continue to make assumptions about the standards that may be adopted by our customers and competitors if the standards adopted are different from those which we have chosen to support market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed and our business will be seriously harmed in addition the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete in addition in order to introduce products incorporating new technologies and new industry standards we must be able to gain access to the latest technologies of our customers our suppliers and other network vendors any failure to gain access to the latest technologies could impair the competitiveness of our products customer requirements are likely to evolve and we will not retain customers or attract new customers if we do not anticipate and meet specific customer requirements our current and prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have to achieve market acceptance for our products we must effectively and timely anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands our failure to develop products or offer services that satisfy customer requirements would seriously harm our ability to increase demand for our products we intend to continue to invest in product and technology development the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends we may experience design manufacturing marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand our inability to effectively manage this transition would cause us to lose current and prospective customers our market is highly competitive and our failure to compete successfully would limit our ability to increase our market share competition in the public network infrastructure market is intense this market has historically been dominated by large companies such as lucent technologies nortel networks cisco systems and ciena corporation in addition a number of private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same network problems which our products address many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater selling and marketing technical manufacturing financial and other resources including vendor sponsored financing programs moreover our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter those markets thereby further intensifying competition in order to compete effectively we must deliver products that provide extremely high network reliability 20 page scale easily and efficiently with minimum disruption to the network interoperate with existing network designs and equipment vendors reduce the complexity of the network by decreasing the need for overlapping equipment provide effective network management and provide a cost effective solution for service providers in addition we believe that a knowledge of the infrastructure requirements applicable to service providers experience in working with service providers to develop new services for their customers and an ability to provide vendor sponsored financing are important competitive factors in our market we have limited ability to provide vendor sponsored financing and this may influence the purchasing decisions of prospective customers who may decide to purchase products from one of our competitors who are able to provide more extensive financing programs any reduction in our current and prospective customer s capital expenditures could result in greater customer demand for vendor sponsored financing if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors we could experience price reductions order cancellations and reduced gross margins any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition we are likely to face difficulties in obtaining and retaining customers if we do not expand our sales organization and our customer service and support operations our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key individuals within our prospective customers organizations this effort requires specialized sales personnel and consulting engineers we are in the process of building our direct sales force and plan to hire additional qualified sales personnel and consulting engineers competition for these individuals is intense and we might not be able to hire and train the kind and number of sales personnel and consulting engineers required for us to be successful in addition we believe that our future success is dependent upon our ability to establish successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners if we are unable to expand our direct sales operations or expand our indirect sales channel we may not be able to increase market awareness or sales of our products which may prevent us from maintaining profitability we are currently expanding our customer service and support organization and will need to increase our staff to support new customers the support of our products requires highly trained customer service and support personnel hiring customer service and support personnel is very competitive in our industry because there are a limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our market once we hire them they may require extensive training in our intelligent optical networking products if we are unable to expand our customer service and support organization and train our personnel rapidly we may not be able to increase sales of our products we depend upon contract manufacturers and any disruption in these relationships may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships we have limited internal manufacturing capabilities we rely on a small number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our products in accordance with our specifications and to fill orders on a timely basis we have a supply contract with celestica corporation which provides comprehensive manufacturing services including assembly test control and shipment to our customers and procures material on our behalf we also have a contract with jabil circuit inc for comprehensive manufacturing services for certain products that are under development we may not be able to effectively manage our relationship with our manufacturers and these manufacturers may not meet our future requirements for timely delivery each of our contract manufacturers also builds products for other companies and we cannot assure you that they will always have sufficient quantities of inventory available to fill orders placed by our customers or that they will allocate their internal 21 page resources to fill these orders on a timely basis in addition our contract with celestica is cancelable without cause on one year s advance notice except for our contracts with celestica and jabil we do not have any on going supply contracts with our manufacturers at present we purchase products from these other manufacturers on a purchase order basis qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our products if we are required or choose to change contract manufacturers we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships we rely on single sources for supply of certain components and our business may be seriously harmed if our supply of any of these components and other components is disrupted we currently purchase several key components including commercial digital signal processors risc processors field programmable gate arrays sonet transceivers and erbium doped fiber amplifiers from single or limited sources we purchase each of these components on a purchase order basis and have no long term contracts for these components although we believe that there are alternative sources for each of these components in the event of a disruption in supply we may not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner or at favorable prices such a failure could hurt our ability to deliver our products to our customers and negatively affect our operating margins in addition our reliance on our suppliers exposes us to potential supplier production difficulties or quality variations any such disruption in supply would seriously impact present and future sales and revenue further the optical component industry is expanding rapidly and manufacturers of optical components may be unable to meet the unpredictable and growing demand for components because optical components are integrated into our products a shortage or decrease in supply would seriously impact future sales and revenue the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock our revenue and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate the primary factors that may affect us include the following fluctuation in demand for intelligent optical networking products the timing and size of sales of our products the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products the timing of recognizing revenue and deferred revenue the rate at which our current and prospective customers fund their network build out new product introductions and enhancements by our competitors and ourselves changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors our ability to develop introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components increases in the prices of the components we purchase our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products the timing and level of prototype expenses costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses and general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications internet and related industries 22 page we plan to increase significantly our operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development expand our sales and marketing operations broaden our customer support capabilities and develop new distribution channels we also plan to expand our general and administrative capabilities to address the increased reporting and other administrative demands which will result from the increasing size of our business our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed as a result a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for the reasons set forth above or for any other reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses due to the foregoing factors we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance you should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in this event the price of our common stock could decrease if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks installations will be delayed or cancelled and could result in substantial product returns which could seriously harm our business many of our customers will require that our products be specifically designed to interface with their existing networks each of which may have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements the requirement that we modify product design in order to achieve a sale may result in a longer sales cycle increased research and development expense and reduced margins on our products if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers networks we would have to modify our products to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers networks installations could be delayed orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned this would also seriously harm our reputation all of which could seriously harm our business and prospects undetected software or hardware errors and problems arising from use of our products in conjunction with other vendors products could result in delays or loss of market acceptance of our products networking products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new versions are released we expect that errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after we begin commercial shipments in addition service providers typically use our products in conjunction with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair costs divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition defects integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could damage market acceptance for our products our customers could also seek damages for losses from us a product liability claim brought against us even if unsuccessful would likely be time consuming and costly our failure to establish and maintain key customer relationships may result in delays in introducing new products or cause customers to forego purchasing our products our future success will also depend upon our ability to develop and manage key customer relationships in order to introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements that address the increasingly 23 page sophisticated needs of our customers our failure to establish and maintain these customer relationships may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and product enhancements in addition we may experience delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the future material delays in introducing new products and enhancements or our inability to introduce competitive new products may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors which could seriously harm our business our failure to continually improve our internal controls and systems and hire needed personnel could impair our future growth we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception we continue to increase the scope of our operations and have grown our headcount substantially for example at july 31 1999 we had a total of 148 employees and at july 31 2000 after giving effect to our acquisition of sirocco we had a total of 687 employees in addition we plan to continue to hire a significant number of employees this fiscal year our growth has placed and our anticipated growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial managerial and manufacturing controls and reporting systems and will need to continue to expand train and manage our work force worldwide we may not be able to implement adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner competition for highly skilled personnel is intense especially in the new england area any failure to attract assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market and if we are unable to retain our key employees our ability to compete could be harmed our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our products if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we cannot assure you that we will not receive claims of this kind or other claims relating to our employees in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel or that those claims will not result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims regardless of their merits in addition defending ourselves or our employees from such claims could divert the attention of our management away from our operations our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third party challenges we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states if competitors are able to use our technology our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 24 page if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive our products could become obsolete from time to time we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements we cannot assure you that third party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms if at all the inability to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs in recent years there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights although we have not been involved in any intellectual property litigation we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an allegation that we infringe others intellectual property any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement these claims and any resulting lawsuit if successful could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights these lawsuits regardless of their success would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or redesign those products that use such technology if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions our business may be seriously harmed we may face risks associated with our international expansion that could impair our ability to grow our revenue abroad we intend to continue to expand our sales into international markets this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successfully direct and indirect international sales and support channels and to support customers in international markets we may not be able to develop international market demand for our products we have limited experience in marketing distributing and supporting our products internationally and to do so we expect that we will need to develop versions of our products that comply with local standards in addition international operations are subject to other inherent risks including greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states unexpected changes in regulatory requirements certification requirements currency fluctuations reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries potentially adverse tax consequences and political and economic instability 25 page any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition as part of our ongoing business development strategy we consider acquisitions and strategic investments in complementary companies products or technologies in september 2000 we completed our acquisition of sirocco systems inc we may also evaluate other potential transactions and transaction prospects in the event of any purchases we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership incur debt assume liabilities incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs our operation of any acquired business and our achieving the benefits of any acquisition including our acquisition of sirocco will also involve numerous risks including problems combining the purchased operations technologies or products unanticipated costs diversion of management s attention from our core business adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and problems with integrating employees and potential loss of key employees particularly those of the purchased organizations we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the benefits of any such acquisition or successfully integrate any acquired businesses products technologies or personnel and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition factors related to the securities market our stock price may be volatile an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly our loss of a major customer significant changes or slowdowns in the funding and spending patterns of our current and prospective customers the addition or departure of key personnel variations in our quarterly operating results announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts new products or product enhancements failure by us to meet our product milestones acquisitions distribution partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments changes in financial estimates by securities analysts sales of our common stock or other securities in the future changes in market valuations of broadband access technology companies changes in market valuations of networking and telecommunications companies and fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes 26 page in addition the stock market in general and the nasdaq national market and technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies such litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock that could cause our stock price to fall as of july 31 2000 options to purchase a total of 27 258 764 shares of our common stock were outstanding which options are subject to vesting schedules in addition in connection with our acquisition of sirocco a total of 28 378 690 shares of our common stock were issued to sirocco stockholders or are issuable upon the exercise of sirocco options we assumed a number of these shares are freely tradeable sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall in addition the sale of shares by our stockholders could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock insiders have substantial control over sycamore and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including changes of control as of september 29 2000 the executive officers directors and entities affiliated with them in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 49 4 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change of control provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders ",

         "item 7 management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations the company reports its activities in one business segment aviation services the table below sets forth net sales for the company s classes of similar products and services within this segment for each of the last three fiscal years ended may 31 three year net sales summary any comparison of net sales for the last three fiscal years should be viewed in light of the economic weakness of the aerospace aviation industry during much of this period the company believes that industry conditions have stabilized and in certain respects improved toward the end of this time frame airlines in general have recently experienced increased aircraft utilization seen growth in revenue passenger and freight miles and posted modest operating gains the company continued to aggressively pursue market opportunities resulting in improved revenues in fiscal 1994 a decline in sales of aviation fasteners due to lower demand by aerospace aviation manufacturers offset what otherwise would have been an increase in trading sales during the three year period further affecting the decline in fastener sales was the company s election not to make significant new investments in inventory for fastener programs with uncertain return potential in a shrinking market during this period the company experienced an increase in engine and airframe parts sales fiscal 1994 overhaul sales increased from the prior year in part due to an increase in maintenance services at the company s oklahoma city facility additionally sales of manufactured products increased in fiscal 1994 from the prior year due primarily to sales to the u s government for the rapid deployment program the company believes it is well positioned to take advantage of available opportunities in the improving aerospace aviation industry for the year ended may 31 1994 1993 1992 000 s omitted net sales trading 199 433 202 464 209 410 overhaul 112 100 102 382 115 250 manufacturing 96 221 77 934 97 997 407 754 382 780 422 657 fiscal 1994 compared with fiscal 1993 the company s operating results improved in fiscal 1994 despite the highly competitive and economically weak aerospace aviation market consolidated net sales for fiscal 1994 increased 24 974 000 or 6 5 over the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increased manufacturing and overhaul sales net income increased 9 211 000 over the prior year which included restructuring expenses of 11 000 000 7 200 000 after tax related to the write down of certain inventories excluding restructuring expenses net income increased 2 011 000 or 26 9 as the result of sales increases and reduced selling general and administrative costs manufacturing sales increased 18 287 000 or 23 5 primarily from the sale of products to the u s government overhaul sales increased 9 718 000 or 9 5 due to increased demand for maintenance services at the oklahoma city facility and increased sales of rotable landing gear inventory trading sales increased in its primary products such as airframe and engine parts 8 page however these gains were offset by reduced demand for aviation fasteners and the company s decision not to enter into fastener programs requiring significant inventory investment with uncertain returns these factors resulted in an overall decline in trading sales of 3 031 000 or 1 5 consolidated gross profit increased 3 474 000 or 5 1 over the prior year primarily due to increased sales revenue fiscal 1994 consolidated gross profit included 700 000 from a reduction in the interest rate on a nonrecourse leveraged lease obligation negotiated by the company and 1 300 000 from leveraged lease repricing required to adjust for tax rate differentials the consolidated gross profit margin was slightly lower than the prior year down from 17 9 to 17 6 trading and manufacturing margins improved year over year while overhaul margins declined the overhaul margin decline was due to increased price competition resulting from maintenance overcapacity in the industry and airlines using lower cost serviceable replacement components in preference to overhaul services consolidated operating income increased 16 481 000 over the prior year without the fiscal 1993 restructuring expenses of 11 000 000 operating income increased 5 481 000 or 33 5 due primarily to the increased sales and a reduction of 2 007 000 in selling general and administrative costs the company maintained its effort to contain costs reduce nonessential spending and create operating efficiencies wherever possible consolidated net income increased 9 211 000 notwithstanding increased interest expense of 1 457 000 due to higher fixed rate interest on debt from the issuance of 50 million of new 7 25 long term notes issued in october 1993 proceeds from this fixed rate debt repaid 28 million of short term bank borrowings at lower interest rates higher margins on fiscal 1994 export sales reduced the effective tax rate which also contributed to the net income increase fiscal 1993 compared with fiscal 1992 consolidated net sales for fiscal 1993 decreased 39 877 000 or 9 from the prior fiscal year net income decreased 9 737 000 or 97 as the result of the sales decrease restructuring expenses of 11 000 000 or 7 200 000 after tax and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin the operating results of each major business activity in fiscal 1993 were adversely impacted by the continued weak economic environment particularly in the aerospace aviation market trading activities benefitted from increased sales of its primary products such as airframe and engine parts even with these increases trading sales decreased 6 946 000 or 3 primarily due to reduced demand for aviation fasteners the demand for fasteners decreased due to aerospace aviation manufacturers reduced requirements caused by delays and cancellations of new aircraft orders and government budget cuts affecting certain defense contractors the sales of overhaul services decreased 13 986 000 or 12 primarily as a result of lower demand and the effect of downsizing the oklahoma city maintenance facility the lower demand was caused by airlines downsizing their active fleets and focusing on lowering maintenance costs the resulting maintenance overcapacity increased competition which resulted in lower prices and a company decision not to compete for certain overhaul work also airlines used lower cost serviceable components abundant in the marketplace in preference to overhauling certain units simultaneously the company took steps within its overhaul activities to reduce costs manufacturing sales decreased 18 945 000 or 20 however it should be noted that fiscal 1992 included 11 000 000 of non recurring product sales for the persian gulf conflict sales for the government s rapid deployment program increased during fiscal 1993 and the order backlog was higher at the end of fiscal 1993 as compared to the same period in fiscal 1992 further sales were reduced due to the reduction and deferral of orders for commercial and military aircraft cargo systems 9 page and spare parts and lower sales at the company s floor maintenance equipment unit due to a recession induced decline in demand intense competition and the effect of converting to a direct distribution system in europe consolidated gross profit contribution decreased 15 004 000 or 18 from fiscal 1992 due to a reduction in sales and a decrease in consolidated gross profit margin from 19 7 to 17 9 lower production and sales levels in relation to fixed costs at a few units as well as increased competition hampered the margin the company s floor maintenance equipment unit was most affected incurring a loss for the year following aggressive cost reduction efforts and an improvement in sales operating performance significantly improved in the third and fourth quarters the consolidated gross profit margin benefitted from sales of airframe and engine parts at margins consistent with the prior year and the effect of cost reductions at the oklahoma city maintenance facility cost reductions implemented company wide during fiscal 1993 benefitted ongoing operations the company reduced selling general and administrative expenses 4 817 000 or 8 in response to a decrease in sales and competitive market conditions the company continued its focus on cost containment and improvement in operating efficiencies in an effort to maintain its operating margins in february 1993 the company recorded noncash restructuring expenses of 11 000 000 for the writedown of certain inventories and associated costs the inventories most affected were parts for older model commercial aircraft certain manufactured products and material supporting original equipment manufacturers the writedown resulted from the company s assessment of the impact on inventories of then very recent changes in the aerospace aviation market as well as the continued recessionary environment the company believes the reduction in inventory value improved its competitive position and facilitated sale of the inventories the income tax benefit of 2 200 000 reported in fiscal 1993 included an expense reduction of 1 200 000 from the reversal of income tax liabilities the income tax benefit before the expense reduction was higher than that determined using the statutory rate as the result of state income tax refunds and the effect of tax benefits on exempt earnings from export sales the provision for income taxes in fiscal 1992 was lower than the amount computed using the statutory federal income tax rate due to tax benefits generated from export sales and an income tax expense reduction of 700 000 the income tax expense reductions were for income tax liabilities recorded in prior years but no longer required due to the conclusion by the internal revenue service of its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for prior years fourth quarter fiscal 1993 sales decreased 8 009 000 or 7 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year however net income increased 300 000 sales and earnings continued to be impacted by adverse market conditions the fourth quarter fiscal 1993 operating results improved from the third quarter fiscal 1993 as the result of a 22 increase in consolidated sales and lower operating costs fiscal 1992 s fourth quarter operating results included restructuring expenses of 5 800 000 or 3 800 000 after tax related to the oklahoma city maintenance facility fiscal 1992 consolidated net sales decreased 43 885 000 or 9 primarily as a result of a cessation of shipments of manufactured logistics support products for the allied coalition in the persian gulf conflict and reduced sales at the company s oklahoma city maintenance facility amounting to 53 000 000 in the prior year these reductions were partially mitigated by increases in certain trading and overhaul activities stemming from the provisioning of transitioned aircraft maintenance part activities and component overhaul activities despite the difficult economic environment and airline customer s curtailment of nonessential spending 10 page consolidated operating income decreased 9 671 000 primarily due to the reductions in consolidated net sales described above and restructuring expenses of 5 800 000 recorded for restructuring and reduction in size of the company s oklahoma city maintenance facility the reduction in the overhaul subsidiary resulted from continued operating losses being experienced by an industry wide overcapacity for certain maintenance services which led to facility and workforce underutilization consolidated net income decreased 4 781 000 as a result of the events impacting consolidated net sales and the restructuring expenses previously described the impact of these events were moderated by interest expense savings attributed to a decline in short term interest rates and a lower provision for income taxes resulting from tax benefits generated from export sales and a reduction of previously recorded tax liabilities no longer required due to the conclusion by the internal revenue service of its examination of previous years federal income tax returns of the company financial

full amount of its credit lines and borrowing facilities the balance of the note proceeds were used for working capital requirements primarily inventory and accounts receivable net cash provided from operating activities decreased 10 109 000 in fiscal 1994 from the prior year as a result of new inventory investments to support government contracts and deposits made on purchases of inventory see note 7 in notes to consolidated financial statements to support new inventory provisioning contracts entered into during fiscal 1994 cash provided in excess of these requirements was used primarily for capital expenditures and to pay dividends the company s financial condition remains solid the company improved its current ratio and working capital position during the year in spite of operating in an aerospace aviation industry that continued to be financially troubled although improving the company s improved financial condition and available sources of financing including its unused bank credit lines and facilities amounting to 132 500 000 will enable the company to meet its anticipated working capital requirements and pursue advantageous business opportunities a summary of key

income of 3 343 274 this represents a decrease of 51 531 from the 1993 investment income of 3 394 805 the decrease is primarily the net result of the elimination of mortgage interest as a result of the sale of the mortgage note held on philadelphia park and the increase in short term investment gains realized from trading securities see note 7 of the accompanying financial statements 1 racetrack segment during the year ended june 30 1994 the racetrack segment realized income of 818 718 before taxes as compared to a loss of 2 451 790 before taxes for the prior fiscal year for purposes of

fiscal year ended june 30 1993 of 4 184 421 the change from operating losses to operating income for the racetrack primarily reflect the effect of the quasi reorganization which significantly reduced depreciation expense by approximately 5 000 000 operating expenses decreased 1 260 597 or 5 primarily as a result of a reduction in the cost of outside service contracts general and administrative expenses were reduced by 782 604 or 18 primarily as a result of a cost reduction program in effect for the year the 1993 fiscal 1994 harness meet 55 days resulted in operating income of approximately 1 146 000 compared with the 1992 harness meet s 53 days operating losses of approximately 951 000 the change primarily reflects the significant decrease in depreciation expense as discussed above in addition the racetrack experienced decreases in the average daily attendance and handle which reduced revenues generated by live racing offset by increased revenues generated by the simulcasting out of these races to new jersey and out of state racetracks and the atlantic city casinos daily on track attendance and wagering at the track s 1993 harness meet averaged 2 674 and 237 558 respectively as compared to 3 330 and 303 908 respectively during the 1992 harness meet although garden state park received approval to conduct its 1994 thoroughbred meet on a four night per week basis for 79

3 492 and 248 534 respectively during the 1993 thoroughbred meet attendance and on track wagering averaged 4 234 and 363 499 respectively during the fiscal year ended june 30 1994 the track realized income of approximately 35 000 during the non racing periods between meets as compared to a loss of approximately 1 961 000 in the prior fiscal year the change was primarily due to the significantly decreased depreciation expense during this fiscal year as compared to last simulcasting both to and from other new jersey racetracks as well as out of state racetracks and casinos accounted for approximately 75 of revenue at garden state park during fiscal 1994 and 1993 2 thoroughbred horse breeding operations revenues and expenses from breeding operations for the current fiscal year ended

499 respectively representing an increase of 299 824 primarily of the increased value of the breeding stock sold during comparable periods as a result of the company having a lower cost basis in the breeding stock sold during the 1994 fiscal year as compared to fiscal 1993 the cost of revenues generated by the breeding segment in the current fiscal year was 166 649 representing a 130 229 or 44 decrease in comparison to last fiscal year operating and depreciation expenses for the current fiscal year were 167 370 representing a 162 034 or 49 decrease from the prior fiscal year due to the number of animals owned during the periods being significantly reduced the breeding segment realized income before taxes of 171 336 as compared to a loss before taxes of 429 697 for the prior fiscal year primarily reflecting the increase in revenues and decrease in expenses during fiscal 1994 as discussed above fiscal year 1993 vs fiscal year 1992 a liquidity and capital resources insofar as the

company incurred after depreciation and taxes a loss of 29 410 166 in comparison to a loss after depreciation and taxes in the prior fiscal year of 6 466 152 primarily as a result of 1 the sale of the philadelphia park mortgage which produced a net non operating loss of 27 599 230 2 reduced interest income as a result of the sale of the mortgage and 3 although cash flow was positive the high cost of depreciation resulted in continued losses at garden state park which was offset by a 1 732 631 extraordinary gain total revenues decreased by approximately 7 from 45 116 124 in fiscal 1992 to 41 872 872 in fiscal 1993 primarily as a result of reduced investment interest income as a result of the sale of the philadelphia park mortgage operating losses decreased 51 or 3 682 616 from 7 266 183

racetrack made possible by a new law which became effective in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2 decreased revenues generated as a result of the reduced number of live racing days during the harness and thoroughbred meets and 3 an overall reduction in expenses the 1992 fiscal 1993 harness meet 53 days resulted in operating losses of approximately 951 000 compared with the 1991 harness meet s 55 days operating losses of approximately 1 857 000 the decrease in operating losses primarily reflect decreases in the average daily attendance and handle offset by increased revenues

782 123 in fiscal 1998 to 957 525 in fiscal 2000 total sales which include pass through sales increased from 856 637 in fiscal 1998 to 1 024 333 in fiscal 2000 the growth in sales was the result of the growing demand for the company s broad line of products and services in the aviation aerospace market whose rate of growth declined slightly the last two fiscal years in fiscal 1998 most of the world s major airlines excluding those in asia reported record or near record operating earnings driven by strong revenue growth and their various initiatives to control costs in 1999 and 2000 however many of the world s airlines experienced lower operating earnings compared to 1998 reflecting slower revenue growth and higher expenses certain domestic aviation aerospace original equipment manufacturers also experienced lower operating earnings during the latter half of the three year period reflecting the overall softening aviation aerospace market in addition during the latter part of the three year period many airlines replaced older aircraft such as the 727 and dc 9 powered by the jt8d engine family and older 747s generally powered by the jt9d engine family in favor of newer aircraft such as the 737 300 747 400 777 a320 and a330 a340 the company continues to develop new repair and overhaul capabilities and other support programs for the newer generation aircraft and engines during fiscal 1998 and 1999 the company s sales before pass through sales benefited from the aggressive pursuit of market opportunities in the relatively strong aviation aerospace market sales in aircraft and engines benefited from new inventory management programs and higher sales of its aircraft and engine sales and leasing products sales in airframe and accessories increased as a result of greater demand for the company s repair and overhaul services and the impact from the acquisition of a new aircraft parts distribution company during 1998 sales in manufacturing increased in 1999 compared to 1998 from strong demand of the company s products supporting u s deployment needs during fiscal 2000 sales before pass through sales increased due to greater demand for the company s repair and overhaul services as well as the company s aircraft and engine sales and leasing products sales in aircraft and engines during fiscal 2000 were negatively impacted by lower engine part sales reflecting fewer shop visits at a main customer s engine overhaul facilities sales in manufacturing during fiscal 2000 were lower mainly as a result of the divestiture of the company s 8 page floor maintenance products manufacturing facility which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 1999 pass through sales increased in fiscal 1999 compared to 1998 mainly as a result of new engine parts inventory management programs but declined in fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of the aforementioned fewer shop visits at a certain customer s engine overhaul facilities the company believes that its established global market position its ability to respond to changes in the industry including technological changes and its diverse customer base position the company to take advantage of future opportunities in the aviation aerospace market fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 consolidated sales in fiscal 2000 before pass through sales increased 4 3 to 957 525 from 918 036 in fiscal 1999 this increase was attributable to higher demand for the company s aircraft and engine sales and leasing products as well as strong demand for the company s repair and overhaul services sales in aircraft and engines increased 24 306 or 5 8 as the company experienced strong demand for its whole engine and aircraft products partially offset by a continued decrease in sales from engine parts inventory management programs this decrease is primarily the result of reduced demand by a major customer for certain engine parts due principally to significantly fewer engine shop visits to this customer for the engine types the company supports the company is working to resolve pending issues with this customer but no assurance can be given that sales to this customer will continue at historical levels in the future the company is aggressively pursuing inventory management programs with other customers and building its engine parts manufacturing capabilities to offset potential future reduced sales to this customer sales in airframe and accessories increased 20 831 or 5 5 reflecting increased demand for the company s aircraft maintenance and landing gear and small component overhaul and repair services these increases were partially offset by lower new aircraft parts sales to general aviation customers sales in manufacturing declined 5 648 or 4 5 as a result of the divestiture of the company s floor maintenance products manufacturing subsidiary in november 1998 partially offset by higher sales of the company s products supporting u s deployment needs pass through sales were 66 808 compared to 132 572 in the prior year as certain of the company s inventory management programs have matured pass through sales have declined as the company has sourced more of its customer s parts requirements with used serviceable parts rather than with factory new parts the reduction in pass through sales during the current fiscal year is attributable to the maturation of the company s existing long term inventory management programs as well as a decline in the number of shop visits for the engine types the company supports at certain long term inventory management programs consolidated gross profit was essentially even with the prior fiscal year the fiscal 2000 consolidated gross profit margin excluding the impact from pass through sales was 18 1 in the current fiscal year compared to 18 9 in the prior year the reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the mix of inventories sold selling general and administrative expenses increased 6 317 or 6 6 as a result of a 4 000 fourth quarter charge to increase bad debts reserve in response to the company s accounts receivable exposure which included two airlines that filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2000 as well as increased information technology costs incurred as a result of the company s e business activities interest expense increased 4 864 principally as a result of increased average short term borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2000 as compared to prior year and interest income increased 1 327 as a result of an increase in average outstanding interest bearing notes receivable during the current year compared to prior year this section contains forward looking statements which are identified with an asterisk please see comments on forward looking statement risk factors in the forward looking statements section on page 12 9 page consolidated net income declined 6 508 or 15 6 from the prior year as a result of the above factors fiscal 1999 compared with fiscal 1998 consolidated sales in fiscal 1999 before pass through sales increased 17 4 to 918 036 from 782 123 in fiscal 1998 this increase was attributable to continued strong demand for the company s broad range of products and services and among other things full year sales from businesses acquired in fiscal 1998 aircraft and engines sales increased 76 897 or 22 7 resulting from higher sales of engine parts driven primarily from strength in inventory management programs and increased aircraft sales and leasing revenues these increases were partially offset by the impact of certain engine parts sales which were recorded by turbine engine asset management l l c an unconsolidated joint venture company during fiscal 1999 but were recorded by aircraft and engines during the first half of fiscal 1998 airframe and accessories sales increased 42 976 or 12 9 driven primarily by the impact of full year sales from the new parts distribution companies acquired during fiscal 1998 as well as increased demand for aircraft maintenance and landing gear overhaul repair capabilities manufacturing sales increased 16 040 or 14 6 due to increased sales of products supporting the u s government s rapid deployment program the inclusion of full year sales from aar composites acquired in fiscal 1998 and higher sales of cargo handling systems these gains were partially offset by the unfavorable impact on sales as a result of the divestiture of the company s floor maintenance products manufacturing subsidiary in november 1998 pass through sales were 132 572 compared to 74 514 in the prior year the increase in pass through sales in the current year as compared to the prior year was attributable to the addition of new inventory management programs during fiscal 1999 and late fiscal 1998 consolidated gross profit increased 24 853 or 16 7 due to increased consolidated net sales the fiscal 1999 consolidated gross profit margin of 18 9 excluding the impact from pass through sales is slightly less than the consolidated gross profit margin of 19 0 of the prior year consolidated operating income increased 12 665 or 19 6 over the prior year on the strength of increased sales partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of consolidated net sales however total expenses increased due to the impact from companies acquired during fiscal 1998 as well as increased marketing support and information technology costs which include year 2000 compliance costs interest expense increased 4 073 or 28 1 over the prior year primarily due to the full year effect of the 60 000 of unsecured 6 875 notes issued in december 1997 consolidated net income increased 6 014 or 16 9 over the prior year as a result of the above noted factors fiscal 1998 compared with fiscal 1997 consolidated net sales before pass through sales increased 192 795 or 32 7 over the prior fiscal year reflecting strong demand for the company s broad range of products and services and the effect of acquisitions during fiscal 1998 acquisitions net of prior year dispositions contributed 77 234 to the sales increase over the prior year aircraft and engines sales increased 76 225 or 29 0 resulting from higher sales in its engine and engine parts businesses as well as increased aircraft sales airframe and accessories sales increased 111 850 or 50 5 driven primarily by sales from the new parts distribution companies which were acquired in fiscal 1998 and increased demand for the company s aircraft maintenance and aircraft component overhaul and repair capabilities sales in manufacturing increased 4 720 or 4 5 reflecting increased cargo loading and handling system sales and the inclusion of sales from atr aar composites which was acquired in october 1997 partially offset by lower sales from products supporting the u s government s rapid 10 page deployment program pass through sales were 74 514 compared to 44 225 reflecting strong demand of engine parts in the company s inventory management programs consolidated gross profit increased 39 865 or 36 7 due to increased consolidated net sales and an increase in the consolidated gross profit margin to 19 0 excluding the impact from pass through sales from 18 4 in the prior year the increase in the consolidated gross profit margin during fiscal 1998 reflected the favorable mix of inventories sold and improved margins in certain manufactured products consolidated operating income increased 21 826 or 50 9 over the prior fiscal year as a result of the increase in net sales and the higher gross profit margin partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of consolidated net sales however total expenses increased principally due to the inclusion of recently acquired companies and increased personnel costs interest expense increased 3 708 or 34 4 over the prior year principally due to the impact of the company s sale of 60 000 of unsecured 6 875 notes in december 1997 consolidated net income increased 12 632 or 54 9 over the prior year as a result of the factors previously discussed liquidity and capital resources at may 31 2000 the company s liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of 1 241 and working capital of 347 451 at may 31 2000 the company s long term debt to capitalization ratio was 34 7 compared to 35 7 at may 31 1999 and the company s total debt to capitalization ratio was 37 8 at may 31 2000 compared to 35 7 at may 31 1999 the company continues to maintain its external sources of financing with 153 326 of unused available bank lines and a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission under which up to 200 million of common stock preferred stock or medium or long term debt securities may be issued or sold subject to market conditions during fiscal 2000 the company generated 10 051 of cash flow from operations compared to 28 525 and 22 823 during fiscal 1999 and 1998 respectively the reduction in cash flow generated from operations was principally due to a reduction in accounts and notes payable and accrued liabilities during the current fiscal year during fiscal 2000 the company s investing activities used 23 209 primarily reflecting the company s investment in property plant and equipment of 22 344 during fiscal 2000 the company s financing activities generated 6 029 of cash reflecting proceeds from short term borrowings of 25 885 partially offset by the purchase of the company s stock of 10 530 and the payment of cash dividends of 9 218

insignificant in fiscal 1999 due to the pending sale of freehold raceway and lease of garden state park and the discontinuance of construction at the el rancho site interest on the csfb credit facility was approximately 7 080 000 during fiscal 1998 and could be lower for fiscal 1999 depending on the timing of the sale of the discontinued operations expenses in connection with the el rancho property for carrying costs including real estate taxes utilities security and maintenance were 974 167 in fiscal 1998 and are expected to be approximately 1 000 000 during fiscal 1999 provided csfb does not make a demand for payment on the csfb note and continues to release funds in the interest reserve account the company currently estimates that the funds made available from the csfb credit facility and placed in the interest reserve account together with cash generated from the company s operations prior to the sale of the discontinued operations will be sufficient to finance its current operations and expected expenditures and carrying costs of the el rancho property until february 1999 prior to june 30 1998 the company determined to sell its racetracks on july 2 1998 the company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement with greenwood new jersey inc greenwood a wholly owned subsidiary of greenwood racing inc which owns philadelphia park racetrack the turf clubs and phonebet for the sale of the real property and related assets at freehold raceway and the lease for a period of seven years of the real property and related assets at garden state park the greenwood agreement the greenwood transaction is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including without limitation approval of the company s stockholders the receipt by the company of a fairness opinion from an independent investment banker and the receipt by greenwood of approval from applicable regulatory authorities the purchase price is 45 million consisting of 33 million in cash and a seven year non contingent promissory note in the amount of 12 million with an additional 10 million in contingent promissory notes becoming effective upon among other things new jersey s approval of off track betting facilities or telephone account pari mutuel wagering on horse racing further adjustments could be made to increase the purchase price if certain additional regulatory gaming changes are approved in new jersey in the future greenwood racing inc will guarantee the performance by greenwood of all obligations under the notes if the greenwood transaction is not completed by december 31 1998 either party has the right to terminate subject to various conditions including greenwoods right of first refusal the company s board has the right at any time prior to the closing to exercise its fiduciary duties and accept a superior proposal for the sale and or lease of freehold raceway and garden state park the company s board is continuing to consider all of the company s strategic options to maximize stockholder value upon the sale of freehold raceway and the lease or sale of garden state park the company will withdraw from any gaming business regulated by the state of new jersey the company s board is considering alternatives for the company s future including the acquisition of one or more operating businesses on july 2 1998 the company entered into the delaware stipulation to resolve the pending stockholder derivative litigation in the delaware court of chancery the delaware settlement is subject to a number of conditions including without limitation an agreement with csfb or an alternate lender the delaware settlement will result in the company s purchase from npd of approximately 2 9 million shares of the company s common stock for 4 6 million plus the assumption by the company of npd s 5 8 million promissory note now held by robert e brennan s bankruptcy trustee the retirement of approximately 2 1 million additional shares of the company s common stock owned by lven the resignation of certain of the company s board members and the termination of various agreements the delaware settlement also contemplates the disposition of the company s non operating el rancho property the delaware settlement will not result in the release by the company of any claims against csfb or standard capital group the timing of the events stated above cannot be estimated at this time however it is expected that the racetrack properties will be sold or leased within one year of june 30 1998 and will materially affect the liquidity of the company when the sale and lease of the racetrack properties occurs as outlined above a portion of cash proceeds from the greenwood transaction and sale of the el rancho property will be used to reduce the company s outstanding debt the company does not know how much if any of such proceeds will be available to the company after repayment of its debt due to the materiality of these outstanding events the timing and the proceeds to be received from the asset sales and the timing of the consummation of the delaware settlement it is impossible to estimate the liquidity needs of the company at this time in the event the company and its lenders are unable to agree upon satisfactory terms the company will need to complete a financing arrangement with an alternative lender in order to complete the anticipated delaware settlement and to provide liquidity beyond february 1999 the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as discussed in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company is in violation of several loan covenants with its major lender is party to various legal proceedings and their proposed settlement and has sustained a loss of approximately 18 3 million for the year ended june 30 1998 all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties seasonality and effect of inclement weather because horse racing is conducted outdoors a number of variables contribute to the seasonality of the business most importantly the weather weather conditions particularly during the winter months sometimes cause cancellations of races or severely curtail attendance which reduces both live racing and simulcast wagering at on site and off site facilities in addition a disproportionate amount of the company s revenue is received during the period september through may of each year because garden state park and freehold raceway conduct only simulcast receiving not live racing during the summer months as a result the company s revenue has been the greatest in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year impact of year 2000 on the company s systems the year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year which may result in systems failures and disruptions to operations at january 1 2000 management is in the process of determining whether all of the company s accounting and operational systems are year 2000 compliant the company has initiated formal communications with its suppliers of the racetrack pari mutuel computer systems to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year 2000 issue although there can be no assurance management does not expect the costs associated with any required conversions of systems to ensure year 2000 compliance to be significant and expects to be year 2000 compliant by its fiscal 1999 year end inflation to date inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations results of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 1998 and 1997 prior to june 30 1998 the company determined to sell its racetracks on july 2 1998 the company entered into the greenwood agreement accordingly the operating results of the racetrack subsidiaries have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for each of the three years in the period ended june 30 1998 also on the same date the company entered into the delaware stipulation to settle certain pending litigation among other actions the delaware settlement contemplates the disposition of the el rancho property the company s fiscal 1998 loss from continuing operations was 25 468 850 as compared to a loss from continuing operations for the prior fiscal year of 15 144 053 an increase in the loss of 10 324 797 this increase in the loss from continuing operations was primarily the result of a an increase in general and administrative expenses of 6 073 387 b an increase in interest expense of 5 517 093 c an increase in amortization of financing costs of 1 910 674 and d the estimated loss in connection with the adjustment to fair market value of the el rancho property of 3 429 251 the increase in the loss was offset by i a write off in fiscal 1997 of 2 585 000 in non refundable deposits associated with the termination of an option to purchase a parcel of land adjoining the el rancho property ii a write off of 2 543 968 in fiscal 1997 associated with the termination of the starship orion concept for the future development of the el rancho property which costs were expensed in fiscal 1997 iii a decrease of 799 460 in el rancho property carrying costs from 1 773 627 in fiscal 1997 to 974 167 in fiscal 1998 and iv an increase in interest income of 677 181 general and administrative expenses of 11 615 972 for fiscal 1998 increased 6 073 387 or 110 from the prior fiscal year amount of 5 542 585 the increase in general and administrative expenses was principally attributable to 1 the accrual of an estimated charge of 3 748 000 the company will incur in connection with the purchase of the 2 904 016 shares from npd and the termination of certain agreements upon consummation of the delaware settlement the charge of 3 748 000 represents the difference between the amount the company will pay for the shares and their estimated fair value 2 an increase in legal expenses of 2 400 000 from 900 000 in fiscal 1997 to 3 300 000 in fiscal 1998 primarily as the result of legal expenses associated with the various director and stockholder lawsuits 3 an increase in officer and corporate administrative salaries and benefits of 470 000 and 4 an increase in non employee option expenses of 337 500 offset by decreases in i taxes of 400 000 ii rental expense of 360 000 and iii various executive travel and related expenses of 262 000 in the absence of a public market for the company s common stock management has determined the estimated fair value fo the common stock referred to in clause 1 above to be the anticipated book value attributable to the common stock after taking into account the estimated operating results until the disposition of the racetrack operations assumed to occur on december 31 1998 the disposal of the racetrack assets and the el rancho property and other transactions contemplated in the delaware settlement there can be no assurance that all of these transactions will occur or if they will occur at the estimated amounts the increase in interest expenses of 5 517 093 was principally attributable to higher interest rates and higher indebtedness levels of the company and the fact that interest was expensed during fiscal 1998 as compared to a portion of the interest being capitalized and a portion being expensed during fiscal 1997 offset by an increase in interest income of 677 181 on the csfb escrow funds the increase in amortization of finance costs of 1 910 674 was principally due to the increased cost of the csfb loan as compared to the cost of the foothill loan income from discontinued operations was 7 207 633 for fiscal 1998 as compared to income from discontinued operations for fiscal 1997 of 1 594 096 an increase of 5 613 537 during fiscal 1998 revenue from racetrack operations at freehold raceway and garden state park increased by an aggregate of 204 568 from the prior fiscal year and racetrack operating expenses decreased by 5 408 969 during the same period primarily as a result of a decrease in wages and benefits and outside services at the two facilities see the separate results for garden state park and freehold raceway below during fiscal 1998 the company incurred a net loss of 18 261 217 as compared to a net loss of 17 387 583 for fiscal 1997 the increase in net loss of 873 634 was the result of those differences described above and a decrease in a loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal 1997 in the amount of 3 837 625 the new jersey division of gaming enforcement dge has conducted an investigation of the company and its directors and significant stockholders in connection with garden state park s and freehold raceway s licenses with the casino control commission ccc and the racing commission the dge issued a report to the ccc in september 1998 in which it objected to the qualification of one director who did not file an application and requested hearings for three stockholders the director and one of the stockholders have requested hearings with the ccc and if the delaware settlement is consummated the other two stockholders will no longer be required to qualify the dge also reserved the right to continue its investigation as to additional directors in the event the delaware settlement is not consummated as a result of the dge s report and subject to the consummation of the delaware settlement the ccc and or racing commission may undertake further proceedings which potentially could jeopardize the company s racing licenses and ability to conduct business with any casino licensees including simulcasting to atlantic city casinos which could have a significant negative impact on the company s operations until the racetracks are sold or leased

increases in simulcasting revenues generated during the period of 784 000 partially offset by lower wagering and attendance from live racing throughout the year total expenses decreased 3 066 595 or 9 in fiscal 1998 primarily as a result of a decrease in wages and benefits of 1 439 000 or 12 additional savings were realized by reducing outside services advertising and promotions insurance materials and supplies and real estate taxes as a result of a settlement of a tax appeal filed effective january 1 1998 as a net result garden state park realized operating income of 1 303 717 during fiscal 1998 as compared to an operating loss during fiscal 1997 of 1 905 124 a change of 3 208 841 the fiscal 1998 harness meet 51 days resulted in operating income of approximately 1 228 000 compared with

compared to an operating loss of approximately 315 000 in the prior fiscal year s non racing periods the increase in the operating profit from a loss to a profit was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating expenses during the period simulcasting during fiscals 1998 and 1997 both to and from other new jersey racetracks as well as out of state racetracks and casinos accounted for approximately 84 and 82 respectively of revenue while live racing and other income accounted for approximately 16 and 18 respectively of revenue at garden state park during fiscals 1998 and 1997

company s balance sheet reflected an accumulated deficit of 13 546 the company does not believe that it has sufficient capital to fund its expenses over the next twelve months the company raised 12 000 in a public offering on october 20 2010 there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the company the company currently has no agreements arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans lines of credit or any other sources since the company has no such arrangements or plans currently in effect its inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on its ability to remain a viable company going concern consideration the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as discussed in the notes to the financial statements the company has no established source of revenue this raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for the company to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty as a result of these uncertainties the report of our registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for fiscal year end february 28 2011 contained an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern the company s activities to date have been supported by equity financing from david johnson the company s ceo and president it has sustained losses in all previous reporting periods with an accumulated deficit of 13 546 as of february 28 2011 management continues to seek funding from its shareholders and other qualified investors to pursue its business plan in the alternative the company may be amenable to a sale merger or other acquisition in the event such transaction is deemed by management to be

identification and evaluation of prospective candidates for a business combination we generate non operating income in the form of interest income on cash and securities held which we expect to be insignificant in view of the low yields on short term government securities we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company for legal financial reporting accounting and auditing compliance as well as for due diligence expenses table_start 26 table_end for the year ended december 31 2016 we had a net loss of 2 861 165 mainly consisting of target identification

arrangements with certain service providers and advisors pursuant to which certain fees incurred by us in connection with the terminated business combination with wki will be deferred and become payable only if we consummate an initial business combination if an initial business combination does not occur we will not be required to pay these contingent fees as of december 31 2016 the amount of these contingent fees was approximately 3 993 000 to the extent a potential initial business combination is consummated we anticipate incurring a significant amount of additional costs there can be no assurances that we will complete any initial business combination for the year ended december 31 2016 cash used in operating activities amounted to 3 501 579 mainly resulting from a net loss of 2 861 165 and interest earned on the trust account of 485 356 offset by an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in the trust account of 11 618 changes in working capital provided 166 676 of

substantially all of the funds held in the trust account less amounts used to pay taxes and deferred underwriting commissions to complete our business combination to the extent that our capital stock or debt is used in whole or in part as consideration to complete our business combination the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies we intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses travel to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or

table_start 27 table_end based upon i amounts held outside the trust account ii interest earned on the trust account available to be released to the company for that payment of income tax obligations and iii loans that the sponsor has committed to provide to the company in each case as described herein we believe we have sufficient cash to operate our business through the earlier of a consummation of a business combination or may 26 2017 the date that the company will be required to cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up if a business combination is not consummated however if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking in depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination moreover we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination subject to compliance with applicable securities laws we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account in addition following our initial business combination if cash on hand is insufficient we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations off balance sheet financing arrangements we have no obligations assets or liabilities which would be considered off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements established any special purpose entities guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or enter into any non financial agreements involving assets contractual obligations we do not have any long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations or long term liabilities other than an administrative agreement to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of 10 000 per month for office space utilities secretarial support and administrative services commencing on the date our securities are first listed on the nasdaq capital market upon the earlier of the completion of the initial business combination or the company s liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the periods reported actual results could materially differ from those estimates we have identified the following significant accounting policy ordinary shares subject to possible redemption we account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic 480 distinguishing liabilities from equity ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption if any are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value conditionally redeemable ordinary shares including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of
